Words
one
the
hearth
and
the
salamander
it
was
a
pleasure
to
burn
it
was
a
special
pleasure
to
see
things
eaten
to
see
things
blackened
and
changed
with
the
brass
nozzle
in
his
fists
with
this
great
python
spitting
its
venomous
kerosene
upon
the
world
the
blood
pounded
in
his
head
and
his
hands
were
the
hands
of
some
amazing
conductor
playing
all
the
symphonies
of
blazing
and
burning
to
bring
down
the
tatters
and
charcoal
ruins
of
history
with
his
symbolic
helmet
numbered
451
on
his
stolid
head
and
his
eyes
all
orange
flame
with
the
thought
of
what
came
next
he
flicked
the
igniter
and
the
house
jumped
up
in
a
gorging
fire
that
burned
the
evening
sky
red
and
yellow
and
black
he
strode
in
a
swarm
of
fireflies
he
wanted
above
all
like
the
old
joke
to
shove
a
marshmallow
on
a
stick
in
the
furnace
while
the
flapping
pigeon
winged
books
died
on
the
porch
and
lawn
of
the
house
while
the
books
went
up
in
sparkling
whirls
and
blew
away
on
a
wind
turned
dark
with
burning
montag
grinned
the
fierce
grin
of
all
men
singed
and
driven
back
by
flame
he
knew
that
when
he
returned
to
the
firehouse
he
might
wink
at
himself
a
minstrel
man
burnt
corked
in
the
mirror
later
going
to
sleep
he
would
feel
the
fiery
smile
still
gripped
by
his
face
muscles
in
the
dark
it
never
went
away
that
smile
it
never
ever
went
away
as
long
as
he
remembered
he
hung
up
his
black
beetle
colored
helmet
and
shined
"it;"
he
hung
his
flameproof
jacket
"neatly;"
he
showered
luxuriously
and
then
whistling
hands
in
pockets
walked
across
the
upper
floor
of
the
fire
station
and
fell
down
the
hole
at
the
last
moment
when
disaster
seemed
positive
he
pulled
his
hands
from
his
pockets
and
broke
his
fall
by
grasping
the
golden
pole
he
slid
to
a
squeaking
halt
the
heels
one
inch
from
the
concrete
floor
downstairs
he
walked
out
of
the
fire
station
and
along
the
midnight
street
toward
the
subway
where
the
silent
air
propelled
train
slid
soundlessly
down
its
lubricated
flue
in
the
earth
and
let
him
out
with
a
great
puff
of
warm
air
onto
the
cream
tiled
escalator
rising
to
the
suburb
whistling
he
let
the
escalator
waft
him
into
the
still
night
air
he
walked
toward
the
corner
thinking
little
at
all
about
nothing
in
particular
before
he
reached
the
corner
however
he
slowed
as
if
a
wind
had
sprung
up
from
nowhere
as
if
someone
had
called
his
name
the
last
few
nights
he
had
had
the
most
uncertain
feelings
about
the
sidewalk
just
around
the
corner
here
moving
in
the
starlight
toward
his
house
he
had
felt
that
a
moment
prior
to
his
making
the
turn
someone
had
been
there
the
air
seemed
charged
with
a
special
calm
as
if
someone
had
waited
there
quietly
and
only
a
moment
before
he
came
simply
turned
to
a
shadow
and
let
him
through
perhaps
his
nose
detected
a
faint
perfume
perhaps
the
skin
on
the
backs
of
his
hands
on
his
face
felt
the
temperature
rise
at
this
one
spot
where
a
person
s
standing
might
raise
the
immediate
atmosphere
ten
degrees
for
an
instant
there
was
no
understanding
it
each
time
he
made
the
turn
he
saw
only
the
white
unused
buckling
sidewalk
with
perhaps
on
one
night
something
vanishing
swiftly
across
a
lawn
before
he
could
focus
his
eyes
or
speak
but
now
tonight
he
slowed
almost
to
a
stop
his
inner
mind
reaching
out
to
turn
the
corner
for
him
had
heard
the
faintest
whisper
breathing
or
was
the
atmosphere
compressed
merely
by
someone
standing
very
quietly
there
waiting
he
turned
the
corner
the
autumn
leaves
blew
over
the
moonlit
pavement
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
girl
who
was
moving
there
seem
fixed
to
a
sliding
walk
letting
the
motion
of
the
wind
and
the
leaves
carry
her
forward
her
head
was
half
bent
to
watch
her
shoes
stir
the
circling
leaves
her
face
was
slender
and
milk
white
and
in
it
was
a
kind
of
gentle
hunger
that
touched
over
everything
with
tireless
curiosity
it
was
a
look
almost
of
pale
"surprise;"
the
dark
eyes
were
so
fixed
to
the
world
that
no
move
escaped
them
her
dress
was
white
and
it
whispered
he
almost
thought
he
heard
the
motion
of
her
hands
as
she
walked
and
the
infinitely
small
sound
now
the
white
stir
of
her
face
turning
when
she
discovered
she
was
a
moment
away
from
a
man
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
waiting
the
trees
overhead
made
a
great
sound
of
letting
down
their
dry
rain
the
girl
stopped
and
looked
as
if
she
might
pull
back
in
surprise
but
instead
stood
regarding
montag
with
eyes
so
dark
and
shining
and
alive
that
he
felt
he
had
said
something
quite
wonderful
but
he
knew
his
mouth
had
only
moved
to
say
hello
and
then
when
she
seemed
hypnotized
by
the
salamander
on
his
arm
and
the
phoenix
disc
on
his
chest
he
spoke
again
of
course
he
said
you
re
our
new
neighbor
aren
t
you
and
you
must
be
she
raised
her
eyes
from
his
professional
symbols
the
fireman
her
voice
trailed
off
how
oddly
you
say
that
i
d
i
d
have
known
it
with
my
eyes
shut
she
said
slowly
what
the
smell
of
kerosene
my
wife
always
complains
he
laughed
you
never
wash
it
off
completely
no
you
don
t
she
said
in
awe
he
felt
she
was
walking
in
a
circle
about
him
turning
him
end
for
end
shaking
him
quietly
and
emptying
his
pockets
without
once
moving
herself
kerosene
he
said
because
the
silence
had
lengthened
is
nothing
but
perfume
to
me
does
it
seem
like
that
really
of
course
why
not
she
gave
herself
time
to
think
of
it
i
don
t
know
she
turned
to
face
the
sidewalk
going
toward
their
homes
do
you
mind
if
i
walk
back
with
you
i
m
clarisse
mcclellan
clarisse
guy
montag
come
along
what
are
you
doing
out
so
late
wandering
around
how
old
are
you
they
walked
in
the
warm
cool
blowing
night
on
the
silvered
pavement
and
there
was
the
faintest
breath
of
fresh
apricots
and
strawberries
in
the
air
and
he
looked
around
and
realized
this
was
quite
impossible
so
late
in
the
year
there
was
only
the
girl
walking
with
him
now
her
face
bright
as
snow
in
the
moonlight
and
he
knew
she
was
working
his
questions
around
seeking
the
best
answers
she
could
possibly
give
well
she
said
i
m
seventeen
and
i
m
crazy
my
uncle
says
the
two
always
go
together
when
people
ask
your
age
he
said
always
say
seventeen
and
insane
isn
t
this
a
nice
time
of
night
to
walk
i
like
to
smell
things
and
look
at
things
and
sometimes
stay
up
all
night
walking
and
watch
the
sun
rise
they
walked
on
again
in
silence
and
finally
she
said
thoughtfully
you
know
i
m
not
afraid
of
you
at
all
he
was
surprised
why
should
you
be
so
many
people
are
afraid
of
firemen
i
mean
but
you
re
just
a
man
after
allon
again
too
soon
he
saw
himself
in
her
eyes
suspended
in
two
shining
drops
of
bright
water
himself
dark
and
tiny
in
fine
detail
the
lines
about
his
mouth
everything
there
as
if
her
eyes
were
two
miraculous
bits
of
violet
amber
that
might
capture
and
hold
him
intact
her
face
turned
to
him
now
was
fragile
milk
crystal
with
a
soft
and
constant
light
in
it
it
was
not
the
hysterical
light
of
electricity
but
what
but
the
strangely
comfortable
and
rare
and
gently
flattering
light
of
the
candle
one
time
as
a
child
in
a
power
failure
his
mother
had
found
and
lit
a
last
candle
and
there
had
been
a
brief
hour
of
rediscovery
of
such
illumination
that
space
lost
its
vast
dimensions
and
drew
comfortably
around
them
and
they
mother
and
son
alone
transformed
hoping
that
the
power
might
not
come
on
again
too
soon
and
then
clarisse
mcclellan
said:
do
you
mind
if
i
ask
how
long
ve
you
worked
at
being
a
fireman
since
i
was
twenty
ten
years
ago
do
you
ever
read
any
of
the
books
you
burn
he
laughed
that
s
against
the
law
oh
of
course
it
s
fine
work
monday
burn
millay
wednesday
whitman
friday
faulkner
burn
em
to
ashes
then
burn
the
ashes
that
s
our
official
slogan
they
walked
still
further
and
the
girl
said
is
it
true
that
long
ago
firemen
put
fires
out
instead
of
going
to
start
them
no
houses
have
always
been
fireproof
take
my
word
for
it
strange
i
heard
once
that
a
long
time
ago
houses
used
to
burn
by
accident
and
they
needed
firemen
to
stop
the
flames
he
laughed
she
glanced
quickly
over
why
are
you
laughing
i
don
t
know
he
started
to
laugh
again
and
stopped
why
you
laugh
when
i
haven
t
been
funny
and
you
answer
right
off
you
never
stop
to
think
what
i
ve
asked
you
he
stopped
walking
you
are
an
odd
one
he
said
looking
at
her
haven
t
you
any
respect
i
don
t
mean
to
be
insulting
it
s
just
i
love
to
watch
people
too
much
i
guess
well
doesn
t
this
mean
anything
to
you
he
tapped
the
numerals
451
stitched
on
his
char
colored
sleeve
yes
she
whispered
she
increased
her
pace
have
you
ever
watched
the
jet
cars
racing
on
the
boulevards
down
that
way
you
re
changing
the
subject
i
sometimes
think
drivers
don
t
know
what
grass
is
or
flowers
because
they
never
see
them
slowly
she
said
if
you
showed
a
driver
a
green
blur
oh
yes
he
d
say
that
s
grass
a
pink
blur
that
s
a
rose
garden
white
blurs
are
houses
brown
blurs
are
cows
my
uncle
drove
slowly
on
a
highway
once
he
drove
forty
miles
an
hour
and
they
jailed
him
for
two
days
isn
t
that
funny
and
sad
too
you
think
too
many
things
said
montag
uneasily
i
rarely
watch
the
parlor
walls
or
go
to
races
or
fun
parks
so
i
ve
lots
of
time
for
crazy
thoughts
i
guess
have
you
seen
the
two
hundred
foot
long
billboards
in
the
country
beyond
town
did
you
know
that
once
billboards
were
only
twenty
feet
long
but
cars
started
rushing
by
so
quickly
they
had
to
stretch
the
advertising
out
so
it
would
last
i
didn
t
know
that
montag
laughed
abruptly
bet
i
know
something
else
you
don
t
there
s
dew
on
the
grass
in
the
morning
he
suddenly
couldn
t
remember
if
he
had
known
this
or
not
and
it
made
him
quite
irritable
and
if
you
look
she
nodded
at
the
sky
there
s
a
man
in
the
moon
he
hadn
t
looked
for
a
long
time
they
walked
the
rest
of
the
way
in
silence
hers
thoughtful
his
a
kind
of
clenching
and
uncomfortable
silence
in
which
he
shot
her
accusing
glances
when
they
reached
her
house
all
its
lights
were
blazing
what
s
going
on
montag
had
rarely
seen
that
many
house
lights
oh
just
my
mother
and
father
and
uncle
sitting
around
talking
it
s
like
being
a
pedestrian
only
rarer
my
uncle
was
arrested
another
time
did
i
tell
you
for
being
a
pedestrian
oh
we
re
most
peculiar
but
what
do
you
talk
about
she
laughed
at
this
good
night
she
started
up
her
walk
then
she
seemed
to
remember
something
and
came
back
to
look
at
him
with
wonder
and
curiosity
are
you
happy
she
said
am
i
what
he
cried
but
she
was
gone
running
in
the
moonlight
her
front
door
shut
gently
happy
of
all
the
nonsense
he
stopped
laughing
he
put
his
hand
into
the
glove
hole
of
his
front
door
and
let
it
know
his
touch
the
front
door
slid
open
of
course
i
m
happy
what
does
she
think
i
m
not
he
asked
the
quiet
rooms
he
stood
looking
up
at
the
ventilator
grill
in
the
hall
and
suddenly
remembered
that
something
lay
hidden
behind
the
grill
something
that
seemed
to
peer
down
at
him
now
he
moved
his
eyes
quickly
away
what
a
strange
meeting
on
a
strange
night
he
remembered
nothing
like
it
save
one
afternoon
a
year
ago
when
he
had
met
an
old
man
in
the
park
and
they
had
talked
montag
shook
his
head
he
looked
at
a
blank
wall
the
girl
s
face
was
there
really
quite
beautiful
in
memory:
astonishing
in
fact
she
had
a
very
thin
face
like
the
dial
of
a
small
clock
seen
faintly
in
a
dark
room
in
the
middle
of
a
night
when
you
waken
to
see
the
time
and
see
the
clock
telling
you
the
hour
and
the
minute
and
the
second
with
a
white
silence
and
a
glowing
all
certainty
and
knowing
what
it
has
to
tell
of
the
night
passing
swiftly
on
toward
further
darknesses
but
moving
also
toward
a
new
sun
what
asked
montag
of
that
other
self
the
subconscious
idiot
that
ran
babbling
at
times
quite
independent
of
will
habit
and
conscience
he
glanced
back
at
the
wall
how
like
a
mirror
too
her
face
"impossible;"
for
how
many
people
did
you
know
that
refracted
your
own
light
to
you
people
were
more
often
he
searched
for
a
simile
found
one
in
his
work
torches
blazing
away
until
they
whiffed
out
how
rarely
did
other
people
s
faces
take
of
you
and
throw
back
to
you
your
own
expression
your
own
innermost
trembling
thought
what
incredible
power
of
identification
the
girl
"had;"
she
was
like
the
eager
watcher
of
a
marionette
show
anticipating
each
flicker
of
an
eyelid
each
gesture
of
his
hand
each
flick
of
a
finger
the
moment
before
it
began
how
long
had
they
walked
together
three
minutes
five
yet
how
large
that
time
seemed
now
how
immense
a
figure
she
was
on
the
stage
before
"him;"
what
a
shadow
she
threw
on
the
wall
with
her
slender
body
he
felt
that
if
his
eye
itched
she
might
blink
and
if
the
muscles
of
his
jaws
stretched
imperceptibly
she
would
yawn
long
before
he
would
why
he
thought
now
that
i
think
of
it
she
almost
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
me
there
in
the
street
so
damned
late
at
night
he
opened
the
bedroom
door
it
was
like
coming
into
the
cold
marbled
room
of
a
mausoleum
after
the
moon
has
set
complete
darkness
not
a
hint
of
the
silver
world
outside
the
windows
tightly
shut
the
chamber
a
tomb
world
where
no
sound
from
the
great
city
could
penetrate
the
room
was
not
empty
he
listened
the
little
mosquito
delicate
dancing
hum
in
the
air
the
electrical
murmur
of
a
hidden
wasp
snug
in
its
special
pink
warm
nest
the
music
was
almost
loud
enough
so
he
could
follow
the
tune
he
felt
his
smile
slide
away
melt
fold
over
and
down
on
itself
like
a
tallow
skin
like
the
stuff
of
a
fantastic
candle
burning
too
long
and
now
collapsing
and
now
blown
out
darkness
he
was
not
happy
he
was
not
happy
he
said
the
words
to
himself
he
recognized
this
as
the
true
state
of
affairs
he
wore
his
happiness
like
a
mask
and
the
girl
had
run
off
across
the
lawn
with
the
mask
and
there
was
no
way
of
going
to
knock
on
her
door
and
ask
for
it
back
without
turning
on
the
light
he
imagined
how
this
room
would
look
his
wife
stretched
on
the
bed
uncovered
and
cold
like
a
body
displayed
on
the
lid
of
a
tomb
her
eyes
fixed
to
the
ceiling
by
invisible
threads
of
steel
immovable
and
in
her
ears
the
little
seashells
the
thimble
radios
tamped
tight
and
an
electronic
ocean
of
sound
of
music
and
talk
and
music
and
talk
coming
in
coming
in
on
the
shore
of
her
unsleeping
mind
the
room
was
indeed
empty
every
night
the
waves
came
in
and
bore
her
off
on
their
great
tides
of
sound
floating
her
wide
eyed
toward
morning
there
had
been
no
night
in
the
last
two
years
that
mildred
had
not
swum
that
sea
had
not
gladly
gone
down
in
it
for
the
third
time
the
room
was
cold
but
nonetheless
he
felt
he
could
not
breathe
he
did
not
wish
to
open
the
drapes
and
open
the
french
windows
for
he
did
not
want
the
moon
to
come
into
the
room
so
with
the
feeling
of
a
man
who
will
die
in
the
next
hour
for
lack
of
air
he
felt
his
way
toward
his
open
separate
and
therefore
cold
bed
an
instant
before
his
foot
hit
the
object
on
the
floor
he
knew
he
would
hit
such
an
object
it
was
not
unlike
the
feeling
he
had
experienced
before
turning
the
corner
and
almost
knocking
the
girl
down
his
foot
sending
vibrations
ahead
received
back
echoes
of
the
small
barrier
across
its
path
even
as
the
foot
swung
his
foot
kicked
the
object
gave
a
dull
clink
and
slid
off
in
darkness
he
stood
very
straight
and
listened
to
the
person
on
the
dark
bed
in
the
completely
featureless
night
the
breath
coming
out
the
nostrils
was
so
faint
it
stirred
only
the
furthest
fringes
of
life
a
small
leaf
a
black
feather
a
single
fiber
of
hair
he
still
did
not
want
outside
light
he
pulled
out
his
igniter
felt
the
salamander
etched
on
its
silver
disc
gave
it
a
flick
two
moonstones
looked
up
at
him
in
the
light
of
his
small
hand
held
"fire;"
two
pale
moonstones
buried
in
a
creek
of
clear
water
over
which
the
life
of
the
world
ran
not
touching
them
mildred
her
face
was
like
a
snow
covered
island
upon
which
rain
might
fall
but
it
felt
no
"rain;"
over
which
clouds
might
pass
their
moving
shadows
but
she
felt
no
shadow
there
was
only
the
singing
of
the
thimble
wasps
in
her
tamped
shut
ears
and
her
eyes
all
glass
and
breath
going
in
and
out
softly
faintly
in
and
out
her
nostrils
and
her
not
caring
whether
it
came
or
went
went
or
came
the
object
he
had
sent
tumbling
with
his
foot
now
glinted
under
the
edge
of
his
own
bed
the
small
crystal
bottle
of
sleeping
tablets
which
earlier
today
had
been
filled
with
thirty
capsules
and
which
now
lay
uncapped
and
empty
in
the
light
of
the
tiny
flare
as
he
stood
there
the
sky
over
the
house
screamed
there
was
a
tremendous
ripping
sound
as
if
two
giant
hands
had
torn
ten
thousand
miles
of
black
linen
down
the
seam
montag
was
cut
in
half
he
felt
his
chest
chopped
down
and
split
apart
the
jet
bombers
going
over
going
over
going
over
one
two
one
two
one
two
six
of
them
nine
of
them
twelve
of
them
one
and
one
and
one
and
another
and
another
and
another
did
all
the
screaming
for
him
he
opened
his
own
mouth
and
let
their
shriek
come
down
and
out
between
his
bared
teeth
the
house
shook
the
flare
went
out
in
his
hand
the
moonstones
vanished
he
felt
his
hand
plunge
toward
the
telephone
the
jets
were
gone
he
felt
his
lips
move
brushing
the
mouthpiece
of
the
phone
emergency
hospital
a
terrible
whisper
he
felt
that
the
stars
had
been
pulverized
by
the
sound
of
the
black
jets
and
that
in
the
morning
the
earth
would
be
covered
with
their
dust
like
a
strange
snow
that
was
his
idiot
thought
as
he
stood
shivering
in
the
dark
and
let
his
lips
go
on
moving
and
moving
they
had
this
machine
they
had
two
machines
really
one
of
them
slid
down
into
your
stomach
like
a
black
cobra
down
an
echoing
well
looking
for
all
the
old
water
and
the
old
time
gathered
there
it
drank
up
the
green
matter
that
flowed
to
the
top
in
a
slow
boil
did
it
drink
of
the
darkness
did
it
suck
out
all
the
poisons
accumulated
with
the
years
it
fed
in
silence
with
an
occasional
sound
of
inner
suffocation
and
blind
searching
it
had
an
eye
the
impersonal
operator
of
the
machine
could
by
wearing
a
special
optical
helmet
gaze
into
the
soul
of
the
person
whom
he
was
pumping
out
what
did
the
eye
see
he
did
not
say
he
saw
but
did
not
see
what
the
eye
saw
the
entire
operation
was
not
unlike
the
digging
of
a
trench
in
one
s
yard
the
woman
on
the
bed
was
no
more
than
a
hard
stratum
of
marble
they
had
reached
go
on
anyway
shove
the
bore
down
slush
up
the
emptiness
if
such
a
thing
could
be
brought
out
in
the
throb
of
the
suction
snake
the
operator
stood
smoking
a
cigarette
the
other
machine
was
working
too
the
other
machine
operated
by
an
equally
impersonal
fellow
in
nonstainable
reddish
brown
coveralls
this
machine
pumped
all
of
the
blood
from
the
body
and
replaced
it
with
fresh
blood
and
serum
got
to
clean
em
out
both
ways
said
the
operator
standing
over
the
silent
woman
no
use
getting
the
stomach
if
you
don
t
clean
the
blood
leave
that
stuff
in
the
blood
and
the
blood
hits
the
brain
like
a
mallet
bang
a
couple
thousand
times
and
the
brain
just
gives
up
just
quits
stop
it
said
montag
i
was
just
sayin
said
the
operator
are
you
done
said
montag
they
shut
the
machines
up
tight
we
re
done
his
anger
did
not
even
touch
them
they
stood
with
the
cigarette
smoke
curling
around
their
noses
and
into
their
eyes
without
making
them
blink
or
squint
that
s
fifty
bucks
first
why
don
t
you
tell
me
if
she
ll
be
all
right
sure
she
ll
be
okay
we
got
all
the
mean
stuff
right
in
our
suitcase
here
it
can
t
get
at
her
now
as
i
said
you
take
out
the
old
and
put
in
the
new
and
you
re
okay
neither
of
you
is
an
m
d
why
didn
t
they
send
an
m
d
from
emergency
hell
the
operator
s
cigarette
moved
on
his
lip
we
get
these
cases
nine
or
ten
a
night
got
so
many
starting
a
few
years
ago
we
had
the
special
machines
built
with
the
optical
lens
of
course
that
was
"new;"
the
rest
is
ancient
you
don
t
need
an
m
d
case
like
"this;"
all
you
need
is
two
handymen
clean
up
the
problem
in
half
an
hour
look
he
started
for
the
door
we
gotta
go
just
had
another
call
on
the
old
ear
thimble
ten
blocks
from
here
someone
else
just
jumped
off
the
cap
of
a
pillbox
call
if
you
need
us
again
keep
her
quiet
we
got
a
contrasedative
in
her
she
ll
wake
up
hungry
so
long
and
the
men
with
the
cigarettes
in
their
straight
lined
mouths
the
men
with
the
eyes
of
puff
adders
took
up
their
load
of
machine
and
tube
their
case
of
liquid
melancholy
and
the
slow
dark
sludge
of
nameless
stuff
and
strolled
out
the
door
montag
sank
down
into
a
chair
and
looked
at
this
woman
her
eyes
were
closed
now
gently
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
feel
the
warmness
of
breath
on
his
palm
mildred
he
said
at
last
there
are
too
many
of
us
he
thought
there
are
billions
of
us
and
that
s
too
many
nobody
knows
anyone
strangers
come
and
violate
you
strangers
come
and
cut
your
heart
out
strangers
come
and
take
your
blood
good
god
who
were
those
men
i
never
saw
them
before
in
my
life
half
an
hour
passed
the
bloodstream
in
this
woman
was
new
and
it
seemed
to
have
done
a
new
thing
to
her
her
cheeks
were
very
pink
and
her
lips
were
very
fresh
and
full
of
color
and
they
looked
soft
and
relaxed
someone
else
s
blood
there
if
only
someone
else
s
flesh
and
brain
and
memory
if
only
they
could
have
taken
her
mind
along
to
the
dry
cleaner
s
and
emptied
the
pockets
and
steamed
and
cleansed
it
and
reblocked
it
and
brought
it
back
in
the
morning
if
only
he
got
up
and
put
back
the
drapes
and
opened
the
windows
wide
to
let
the
night
air
in
it
was
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
was
it
only
an
hour
ago
clarisse
mcclellan
in
the
street
and
him
coming
in
and
the
dark
room
and
his
foot
kicking
the
little
crystal
bottle
only
an
hour
but
the
word
had
melted
down
and
sprung
up
in
a
new
and
colorless
form
laughter
blew
across
the
moon
colored
lawn
from
the
house
of
clarisse
and
her
father
and
mother
and
the
uncle
who
smiled
so
quietly
and
so
earnestly
above
all
their
laughter
was
relaxed
and
hearty
and
not
forced
in
any
way
coming
from
the
house
that
was
so
brightly
lit
this
late
at
night
while
all
the
other
houses
were
kept
to
themselves
in
darkness
montag
heard
the
voices
talking
talking
talking
giving
talking
weaving
reweaving
their
hypnotic
web
montag
moved
out
through
the
french
windows
and
crossed
the
lawn
without
even
thinking
of
it
he
stood
outside
the
talking
house
in
the
shadows
thinking
he
might
even
tap
on
their
door
and
whisper
let
me
come
in
i
won
t
say
anything
i
just
want
to
listen
what
is
it
you
re
saying
but
instead
he
stood
there
very
cold
his
face
a
mask
of
ice
listening
to
a
man
s
voice
the
uncle
moving
along
at
an
easy
pace:
well

what

they
wearing
as
they
trot
out
on
the
field
montag
moved
back
to
his
own
house
left
the
window
wide
checked
mildred
tucked
the
covers
about
her
carefully
and
then
lay
down
with
the
moonlight
on
his
che
ekbones
and
on
the
frowning
ridges
in
his
brow
with
the
moonlight
distilled
in
each
eye

he
said
and
let
a
sleep
lozenge
dissolve
on
his
tongue
at
nine
in
the
morning
mildred
s
bed
was
empty
montag
got
up
quickly
his
heart
pumping
and
ran
down
the
hall
and
stopped
at
the
kitchen
door
toast
popped
out
of
the
silver
toaster
was
seized
by
a
spidery
metal
hand
that
drenched
it
with
melted
butter
mildred
watched
the
toast
delivered
to
her
plate
she
had
both
ears
plugged
with
electronic
bees
that
were
humming
the
hour
away
she
looked
up
suddenly
saw
him
and
nodded
you
all
right
he
asked
she
was
an
expert
at
lip
reading
from
ten
years
of
apprenticeship
at
seashell
ear
thimbles
she
nodded
again
she
set
the
toaster
clicking
away
at
another
piece
of
bread
montag
sat
down
his
wife
said
i
don
t
know
why
i
should
be
so
hungry
you
i
m
hungry
last
night
he
began
didn
t
sleep
well
feel
terrible
she
said
god
i
m
hungry
i
can
t
figure
it
last
night
he
said
again
she
watched
his
lips
casually
what
about
last
night
don
t
you
remember
what
did
we
have
a
wild
party
or
something
feel
like
i
ve
a
hangover
god
i
m
hungry
who
was
here
a
few
people
he
said
that
s
what
i
thought
she
chewed
her
toast
sore
stomach
but
i
m
hungry
as
all
get
out
hope
i
didn
t
do
anything
foolish
at
the
party
no
he
said
quietly
the
toaster
spidered
out
a
piece
of
buttered
bread
for
him
he
held
it
in
his
hand
feeling
obligated
you
don
t
look
so
hot
yourself
said
his
wife
in
the
late
aftenoon
it
rained
and
the
entire
world
was
dark
gray
he
stood
in
the
hall
of
his
house
putting
on
his
badge
with
the
orange
salamander
burning
across
it
he
stood
looking
up
at
the
air
conditioning
vent
in
the
hall
for
a
long
time
his
wife
in
the
tv
parlor
paused
long
enough
from
reading
her
script
to
glance
up
hey
she
said
the
man
s
thinking
yes
he
said
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
he
paused
you
took
all
the
pills
in
your
bottle
last
night
oh
i
wouldn
t
do
that
she
said
surprised
the
bottle
was
empty
i
wouldn
t
do
a
thing
like
that
why
would
i
do
a
thing
like
that
she
said
maybe
you
took
two
pills
and
forgot
and
took
two
more
and
forgot
again
and
took
two
more
and
were
so
dopey
you
kept
right
on
until
you
had
thirty
or
forty
of
them
in
you
heck
she
said
what
would
i
want
to
go
and
do
a
silly
thing
like
that
for
i
don
t
know
he
said
she
was
quite
obviously
waiting
for
him
to
go
i
didn
t
do
that
she
said
never
in
a
billion
years
all
right
if
you
say
so
he
said
that
s
what
the
lady
said
she
turned
back
to
her
script
what
s
on
this
afternoon
he
asked
tiredly
she
didn
t
look
up
from
the
script
again
well
this
is
a
play
comes
on
the
wall
to
wall
circuit
in
ten
minutes
they
mailed
me
my
part
this
morning
i
sent
in
some
box
tops
they
write
the
script
with
one
part
missing
it
s
a
new
idea
the
homemaker
that
s
me
is
the
missing
part
when
it
comes
time
for
the
missing
lines
they
all
look
at
me
out
of
the
three
walls
and
i
say
the
lines
here
for
instance
the
man
says
what
do
you
think
of
this
whole
idea
helen
and
he
looks
at
me
sitting
here
center
stage
see
and
i
say
i
say
she
paused
and
ran
her
finger
under
a
line
on
the
script
i
think
that
s
fine
and
then
they
go
on
with
the
play
until
he
says
do
you
agree
to
that
helen
and
i
say
i
sure
do
isn
t
that
fun
guy
he
stood
in
the
hall
looking
at
her
it
s
sure
fun
she
said
what
s
the
play
about
i
just
told
you
there
are
these
people
named
bob
and
ruth
and
helen
oh
it
s
really
fun
it
ll
be
even
more
fun
when
we
can
afford
to
have
the
fourth
wall
installed
how
long
you
figure
before
we
save
up
and
get
the
fourth
wall
torn
out
and
a
fourth
wall
tv
put
in
it
s
only
two
thousand
dollars
that
s
one
third
of
my
yearly
pay
it
s
only
two
thousand
dollars
she
replied
and
i
should
think
you
d
consider
me
sometimes
if
we
had
a
fourth
wall
why
it
d
be
just
like
this
room
wasn
t
ours
at
all
but
all
kinds
of
exotic
people
s
rooms
we
could
do
without
a
few
things
we
re
already
doing
without
a
few
things
to
pay
for
the
third
wall
it
was
put
in
only
two
months
ago
remember
is
that
all
it
was
she
sat
looking
at
him
for
a
long
moment
well
goodbye
dear
goodbye
he
said
he
stopped
and
turned
around
does
it
have
a
happy
ending
i
haven
t
read
that
far
he
walked
over
read
the
last
page
nodded
folded
the
script
and
handed
it
back
to
her
he
walked
out
of
the
house
into
the
rain
the
rain
was
thinning
away
and
the
girl
was
walking
in
the
center
of
the
sidewalk
with
her
head
up
and
the
few
drops
falling
on
her
face
she
smiled
when
she
saw
montag
hello
he
said
hello
and
then
said
what
are
you
up
to
now
i
m
still
crazy
the
rain
feels
good
i
love
to
walk
in
it
i
don
t
think
i
d
like
that
he
said
you
might
if
you
tried
i
never
have
she
licked
her
lips
rain
even
tastes
good
what
do
you
do
go
around
trying
everything
once
he
asked
sometimes
twice
she
looked
at
something
in
her
hand
what
ve
you
got
there
he
said
i
guess
it
s
the
last
of
the
dandelions
this
year
i
didn
t
think
i
d
find
one
on
the
lawn
this
late
have
you
ever
heard
of
rubbing
it
under
your
chin
look
she
touched
her
chin
with
the
flower
laughing
why
if
it
rubs
off
it
means
i
m
in
love
has
it
he
could
hardly
do
anything
else
but
look
well
she
said
you
re
yellow
under
there
fine
let
s
try
you
now
it
won
t
work
for
me
here
before
he
could
move
she
had
put
the
dandelion
under
his
chin
he
drew
back
and
she
laughed
hold
still
she
peered
under
his
chin
and
frowned
well
he
said
what
a
shame
she
said
you
re
not
in
love
with
anyone
yes
i
am
it
doesn
t
show
i
am
very
much
in
love
he
tried
to
conjure
up
a
face
to
fit
the
words
but
there
was
no
face
i
am
oh
please
don
t
look
that
way
it
s
that
dandelion
he
said
you
ve
used
it
all
up
on
yourself
that
s
why
it
won
t
work
for
me
of
course
that
must
be
it
oh
now
i
ve
upset
you
i
can
see
i
"have;"
i
m
sorry

i
am
she
touched
his
elbow
no

he
said
quickly
i
m

ve
got
to
be
going
so
say
you
forgive
me
i
don
t
want
you

i
don
t
know
what
he
thinks
of
me
he
says
i
m
a
regular
onion
i
keep
him
busy
peeling
away
the
layers
i
m
inclined
to
believe
you
need
the
psychiatrist
said
montag
you
don
t
mean
that
he
took
a
breath
and
let
it
out
and
at
last
said
no
i
don
t
meant
that
&nbs
"p;"
the
psychiatrist
wants
to
know
why
i
go
out
and
hike
around
in
the
forests
and
watch
the
birds
and
collect
butterflies
i
ll
show
you
my
collection
some
day
good
they
want
to
know
what
i
do
with
all
my
time
i
tell
them
that
sometimes
i
just
sit
and
think
but
i
won
t
tell
them
what
i
ve
got
them
running
and
sometimes
i
tell
them
i
like
to
put
my
head
back
like
this
and
let
the
rain
fall
in
my
mouth
it
tastes
just
like
wine
have
you
ever
tried
it
no
i
you
have
forgiven
me
haven
t
you
yes
he
thought
about
it
yes
i
have
god
knows
why
you
re
peculiar
you
re
aggravating
yet
you
re
easy
to
forgive
you
say
you
re
seventeen
well
next
month
how
odd
how
strange
and
my
wife
thirty
and
yet
you
seem
so
much
older
at
times
i
can
t
get
over
it
you
re
peculiar
yourself
mr
montag
sometimes
i
even
forget
you
re
a
fireman
now
may
i
make
you
angry
again
go
ahead
how
did
it
start
how
did
you
get
into
it
how
did
you
pick
your
work
and
how
did
you
happen
to
think
to
take
the
job
you
have
you
re
not
like
the
others
i
ve
seen
a
"few;"
i
know
when
i
talk
you
look
at
me
when
i
said
something
about
the
moon
you
looked
at
the
moon
last
night
the
others
would
never
do
that
the
others
would
walk
off
and
leave
me
talking
or
threaten
me
no
one
has
time
any
more
for
anyone
else
you
re
one
of
the
few
who
put
up
with
me
that
s
why
i
think
it
s
so
strange
you
re
a
fireman
it
just
doesn
t
seem
right
for
you
somehow
he
felt
his
body
divide
itself
into
a
hotness
and
a
coldness
a
softness
and
a
hardness
a
trembling
and
a
not
trembling
the
two
halves
grinding
one
upon
the
other
you
d
better
run
on
to
your
appointment
he
said
and
she
ran
off
and
left
him
standing
there
in
the
rain
only
after
a
long
time
did
he
move
and
then
very
slowly
as
he
walked
he
tilted
his
head
back
in
the
rain
for
just
a
few
moments
and
opened
his
mouth
the
mechanical
hound
slept
but
did
not
sleep
lived
but
did
not
live
in
its
gently
humming
gently
vibrating
softly
illuminated
kennel
back
in
a
dark
corner
of
the
firehouse
the
dim
light
of
one
in
the
morning
the
moonlight
from
the
open
sky
framed
through
the
great
window
touched
here
and
there
on
the
brass
and
the
copper
and
the
steel
of
the
faintly
trembling
beast
light
flickered
on
bits
of
ruby
glass
and
on
sensitive
capillary
hairs
in
the
nylon
brushed
nostrils
of
the
creature
that
quivered
gently
gently
its
eight
legs
spidered
under
it
on
rubber
padded
paws
montag
slid
down
the
brass
pole
he
went
out
to
look
at
the
city
and
the
clouds
had
cleared
away
completely
and
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
came
back
to
bend
down
and
look
at
the
hound
it
was
like
a
great
bee
come
home
from
some
field
where
the
honey
is
full
of
poison
wildness
of
insanity
and
nightmare
its
body
crammed
with
that
over
rich
nectar
and
now
it
was
sleeping
the
evil
out
of
itself
hello
whispered
montag
fascinated
as
always
with
the
dead
beast
the
living
beast
nights
when
things
got
dull
which
was
every
night
the
men
slid
down
the
brass
poles
and
set
the
ticking
combinations
of
the
olfactory
system
of
the
hound
and
let
loose
rats
in
the
firehouse
areaway
and
sometimes
chickens
and
sometimes
cats
that
would
have
to
be
drowned
anyway
and
there
would
be
betting
to
see
which
of
the
cats
or
chickens
or
rats
the
hound
would
seize
first
the
animals
were
turned
loose
three
seconds
later
the
game
was
done
the
rat
cat
or
chicken
caught
half
across
the
areaway
gripped
in
gentling
paws
while
a
four
inch
hollow
steel
needle
plunged
down
from
the
proboscis
of
the
hound
to
inject
massive
jolts
of
morphine
or
procaine
the
pawn
was
then
tossed
in
the
incinerator
a
new
game
began
montag
stayed
upstairs
most
nights
when
this
went
on
there
had
been
a
time
two
years
ago
when
he
had
bet
with
the
best
of
them
and
lost
a
week
s
salary
and
faced
mildred
s
insane
anger
which
showed
itself
in
veins
and
blotches
but
now
nights
he
lay
in
his
bunk
face
turned
to
the
wall
listening
to
the
whoops
of
laughter
below
and
the
piano
string
scurry
of
rat
feet
the
violin
squeaking
of
mice
and
the
great
shadowing
motioned
silence
of
the
hound
leaping
out
like
a
moth
in
the
raw
light
finding
holding
its
victim
inserting
needle
and
going
back
to
its
kennel
to
die
as
if
a
switch
had
been
turned
montag
touched
the
muzzle
the
hound
growled
montag
jumped
back
the
hound
half
rose
in
its
kennel
and
looked
at
him
with
green
blue
neon
light
flickering
in
its
suddenly
activated
eye
bulbs
it
growled
again
a
strange
rasping
combination
of
electrical
sizzle
a
frying
sound
a
scraping
of
metal
a
turning
of
cogs
that
seemed
rusty
and
ancient
with
suspicion
no
no
boy
said
montag
his
heart
pounding
he
saw
the
silver
needle
extend
upon
the
air
an
inch
pull
back
extend
pull
back
the
growl
simmered
in
the
beast
and
it
looked
at
him
montag
backed
up
the
hound
took
a
step
from
its
kennel
montag
grabbed
the
brass
pole
with
one
hand
the
pole
reacting
slid
upward
and
took
him
through
the
ceiling
quietly
he
stepped
off
in
the
half
lit
deck
of
the
upper
level
he
was
trembling
and
his
face
was
green
white
below
the
hound
had
sunk
back
down
upon
its
eight
incredible
insect
legs
and
was
humming
to
itself
again
its
multifaceted
eyes
at
peace
montag
stood
letting
the
fears
pass
by
the
drop
hole
behind
him
four
men
at
a
card
table
under
a
green
lidded
light
in
the
corner
glanced
briefly
but
said
nothing
only
the
man
with
the
captain
s
hat
and
the
sign
of
the
phoenix
on
his
hat
at
last
curious
his
playing
cards
in
his
thin
hand
talked
across
the
long
room
montag
it
doesn
t
like
me
said
montag
what
the
hound
the
captain
studied
his
cards
come
off
it
it
doesn
t
like
or
dislike
it
just
functions
it
s
like
a
lesson
in
ballistics
it
has
a
trajectory
we
decide
on
for
it
it
follows
through
it
targets
itself
homes
itself
and
cuts
off
it
s
only
copper
wire
storage
batteries
and
electricity
montag
swallowed
its
calculators
can
be
set
to
any
combination
so
many
amino
acids
so
much
sulphur
so
much
butterfat
and
alkaline
right
we
know
all
that
all
of
those
chemical
balances
and
percentages
on
all
of
us
here
in
the
house
are
recorded
in
the
master
file
downstairs
it
would
be
easy
for
someone
to
set
up
a
partial
combination
on
the
hound
s
memory
a
touch
of
amino
acids
perhaps
that
would
account
for
what
the
animal
did
just
now
reacted
toward
me
hell
said
the
captain
irritated
but
not
completely
angry
just
enough
memory
set
up
in
it
by
someone
so
it
growled
when
i
touched
it
who
would
do
a
thing
like
that
asked
the
captain
you
haven
t
any
enemies
here
guy
none
that
i
know
of
we
ll
have
the
hound
checked
by
our
technicians
tomorrow
this
isn
t
the
first
time
it
s
threatened
me
said
montag
last
month
it
happened
twice
we
ll
fix
it
up
don
t
worry
but
montag
did
not
move
and
only
stood
thinking
of
the
ventilator
grill
in
the
hall
at
home
and
what
lay
hidden
behind
the
grill
if
someone
here
in
the
firehouse
knew
about
the
ventilator
then
mightn
t
they
tell
the
hound
the
captain
came
over
to
the
drop
hole
and
gave
montag
a
questioning
glance
i
was
just
figuring
said
montag
what
does
the
hound
think
about
down
there
nights
is
it
coming
alive
on
us
really
it
makes
me
cold
it
doesn
t
think
anything
we
don
t
want
it
to
think
that
s
sad
said
montag
quietly
because
all
we
put
into
it
is
hunting
and
finding
and
killing
what
a
shame
if
that
s
all
it
can
ever
know
beatty
snorted
gently
hell
it
s
a
fine
bit
of
craftsmanship
a
good
rifle
that
can
fetch
its
own
target
and
guarantees
the
bull
s
eye
every
time
that
s
why
said
montag
i
wouldn
t
want
to
be
its
next
victim
why
you
got
a
guilty
conscience
about
something
montag
glanced
up
swiftly
beatty
stood
there
looking
at
him
steadily
with
his
eyes
while
his
mouth
opened
and
began
to
laugh
very
softly
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
days
and
as
many
times
he
came
out
of
the
house
and
clarisse
was
there
somewhere
in
the
world
once
he
saw
her
shaking
a
walnut
tree
once
he
saw
her
sitting
on
the
lawn
knitting
a
blue
sweater
three
or
four
times
he
found
a
bouquet
of
late
flowers
on
his
porch
or
a
handful
of
chestnuts
in
a
little
sack
or
some
autumn
leaves
neatly
pinned
to
a
sheet
of
white
paper
and
thumbtacked
to
his
door
every
day
clarisse
walked
him
to
the
corner
one
day
it
was
raining
the
next
it
was
clear
the
day
after
that
the
wind
blew
strong
and
the
day
after
that
it
was
mild
and
calm
and
the
day
after
that
calm
day
was
a
day
like
the
furnace
of
summer
and
clarisse
with
her
face
all
sunburnt
by
late
afternoon
why
is
it
he
said
one
time
at
the
subway
entrance
i
feel
i
ve
known
you
so
many
years
because
i
like
you
she
said
and
i
don
t
want
anything
from
you
and
because
we
know
each
other
you
make
me
feel
very
old
and
very
much
like
a
father
now
you
explain
she
said
why
you
haven
t
any
daughters
like
me
if
you
love
children
so
much
i
don
t
know
you
re
joking
i
mean
he
stopped
and
shook
his
head
well
my
wife
she
she
just
never
wanted
any
children
at
all
the
girl
stopped
smiling
i
m
sorry
i
really
thought
you
were
having
fun
at
my
expense
i
m
a
fool
no
no
he
said
it
was
a
good
question
it
s
been
a
long
time
since
anyone
cared
enough
to
ask
a
good
question
let
s
talk
about
something
else
have
you
ever
smelled
old
leaves
don
t
they
smell
like
cinnamon
here
smell
why
yes
it
is
like
cinnamon
in
a
way
she
looked
at
him
with
her
clear
dark
eyes
you
always
seem
shocked
it
s
just
i
haven
t
had
time
did
you
look
at
the
stretched
out
billboards
like
i
told
you
i
think
so
yes
he
had
to
laugh
your
laugh
sounds
much
nicer
than
it
did
does
it
much
more
relaxed
he
felt
at
ease
and
comfortable
why
aren
t
you
in
school
i
see
you
every
day
wandering
around
oh
they
don
t
miss
me
she
said
i
m
antisocial
they
say
i
don
t
mix
it
s
so
strange
i
m
very
social
indeed
it
all
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
social
doesn
t
it
social
to
me
means
talking
to
you
about
things
like
this
she
rattled
some
chestnuts
that
had
fallen
off
the
tree
in
the
front
yard
or
talking
about
how
strange
the
world
is
being
with
people
is
nice
but
i
don
t
think
it
s
social
to
get
a
bunch
of
people
together
and
then
not
let
them
t
alk
do
you
an
hour
of
tv
class
an
hour
of
basketball
or
baseball
or
running
another
hour
of
transcription
history
or
painting
pictures
and
more
sports
but
do
you
know
we
never
ask
questions
or
at
least
most
don
"t;"
they
just
run
the
answers
at
you
bing
bing
bing
and
us
sitting
there
for
four
more
hours
of
film
teacher
that
s
not
social
to
me
at
all
it
s
a
lot
of
funnels
and
a
lot
of
water
poured
down
the
spout
and
out
the
bottom
and
them
telling
us
it
s
wine
when
it
s
not
they
run
us
so
ragged
by
the
end
of
the
day
we
can
t
do
anything
but
go
to
bed
or
head
for
a
fun
park
to
bully
people
around
break
windowpanes
in
the
window
smasher
place
or
wreck
cars
in
the
car
wrecker
place
with
the
big
steel
ball
or
go
out
in
the
cars
and
race
on
the
streets
trying
to
see
how
close
you
can
get
to
lampposts
playing
chicken
and
knock
hubcaps
i
guess
i
m
everything
they
say
i
am
all
right
i
haven
t
any
friends
that
s
supposed
to
prove
i
m
abnormal
but
everyone
i
know
is
either
shouting
or
dancing
around
like
wild
or
beating
up
one
another
do
you
notice
how
people
hurt
each
other
nowadays
you
sound
so
very
old
sometimes
i
m
ancient
i
m
afraid
of
children
my
own
age
they
kill
each
other
did
it
always
used
to
be
that
way
my
uncle
says
no
six
of
my
friends
have
been
shot
in
the
last
year
alone
ten
of
them
died
in
car
wrecks
i
m
afraid
of
them
and
they
don
t
like
me
because
i
m
afraid
my
uncle
says
his
grandfather
remembered
when
children
didn
t
kill
each
other
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
when
they
had
things
different
they
believed
in
responsibility
my
uncle
says
do
you
know
i
m
responsible
i
was
spanked
when
i
needed
it
years
ago
and
i
do
all
the
shopping
and
housecleaning
by
hand
but
most
of
all
she
said
i
like
to
watch
people
sometimes
i
ride
the
subway
all
day
and
look
at
them
and
listen
to
them
i
just
want
to
figure
out
who
they
are
and
what
they
want
and
where
they
re
going
sometimes
i
even
go
to
the
fun
parks
and
ride
in
the
jet
cars
when
they
race
on
the
edge
of
town
at
midnight
and
the
police
don
t
care
as
long
as
they
re
insured
as
long
as
everyone
has
ten
thousand
insurance
everyone
s
happy
sometimes
i
sneak
around
and
listen
in
subways
or
i
listen
at
soda
fountains
and
do
you
know
what
what
people
don
t
talk
about
anything
oh
they
must
no
not
anything
they
name
a
lot
of
cars
or
clothes
or
swimming
pools
mostly
and
say
how
swell
but
they
all
say
the
same
things
and
nobody
says
anything
different
from
anyone
else
and
most
of
the
time
in
the
cafes
they
have
the
joke
boxes
on
and
the
same
jokes
most
of
the
time
or
the
musical
wall
lit
and
all
the
colored
patterns
running
up
and
down
but
it
s
only
color
and
all
abstract
and
at
the
museums
have
you
ever
been
all
abstract
that
s
all
there
is
now
my
uncle
says
it
was
different
once
a
long
time
back
sometimes
pictures
said
things
or
even
showed
people
your
uncle
said
your
uncle
said
your
uncle
must
be
a
remarkable
man
he
is
he
certainly
is
well
i
got
to
be
going
goodbye
mr
montag
goodbye
goodbye
one

days:
the
firehouse
montag
you
shin
that
pole
like
a
bird
up
a
tree

montag
i
see
you
came
in
the
back
door
this
time
the
hound
bother
you
no
no
fourth
day
montag
a
funny
thing
heard
tell
this
morning
fireman
in
seattle
purposely
set
a
mechanical
hound
to
his
own
chemical
complex
and
let
it
loose
what
kind
of
suicide
would
you
call
that
five
six
seven
days
and
then
clarisse
was
gone
he
didn
t
know
what
there
was
about
the
afternoon
but
it
was
not
seeing
her
somewhere
in
the
world
the
lawn
was
empty
the
trees
empty
the
street
empty
and
while
at
first
he
did
not
even
know
he
missed
her
or
was
even
looking
for
her
the
fact
was
that
by
the
time
he
reached
the
subway
there
were
vague
stirrings
of
disease
in
him
something
was
the
matter
his
routine
had
been
disturbed
a
simple
routine
true
established
in
a
short
few
days
and
yet
he
almost
turned
back
to
make
the
walk
again
to
give
her
time
to
appear
he
was
certain
if
he
tried
the
same
route
everything
would
work
out
fine
but
it
was
late
and
the
arrival
of
his
train
put
a
stop
to
his
plan
the
flutter
of
cards
motion
of
hands
of
eyelids
the
drone
of
the
time
voice
in
the
firehouse
ceiling
one
thirty

thursday
morning
november
4th
one
thirty
six
one
thirty
seven
a
m
the
tick
of
the
playing
cards
on
the
greasy
tabletop
all
the
sounds
came
to
montag
behind
his
closed
eyes
behind
the
barrier
he
had
momentarily
erected
he
could
feel
the
firehouse
full
of
glitter
and
shine
and
silence
of
brass
colors
the
colors
of
coins
of
gold
of
silver
the
unseen
men
across
the
table
were
sighing
on
their
cards
waiting
one
forty
five
the
voice
clock
mourned
out
the
cold
hour
of
a
cold
morning
of
a
still
colder
year
what
s
wrong
montag
montag
opened
his
eyes
a
radio
hummed
somewhere
war
may
be
declared
any
hour
this
country
stands
ready
to
defend
its
the
firehouse
trembled
as
a
great
flight
of
jet
planes
whistled
a
single
note
across
the
black
morning
sky
montag
blinked
beatty
was
looking
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
museum
statue
at
any
moment
beatty
might
rise
and
walk
about
him
touching
exploring
his
guilt
and
self
consciousness
guilt
what
guilt
was
that
your
play
montag
montag
looked
at
these
men
whose
faces
were
sunburnt
by
a
thousand
real
and
ten
thousand
imaginary
fires
whose
work
flushed
their
cheeks
and
fevered
their
eyes
these
men
who
looked
steadily
into
their
platinum
igniter
flames
as
they
lit
their
eternally
burning
black
pipes
they
and
their
charcoal
hair
and
soot
colored
brows
and
bluish
ash
smeared
cheeks
where
they
had
shaven
"close;"
but
their
heritage
showed
montag
started
up
his
mouth
opened
had
he
ever
seen
a
fireman
that
didn
t
have
black
hair
black
brows
a
fiery
face
and
a
blue
steel
shaved
but
unshaved
look
these
men
were
all
mirror
images
of
himself
were
all
firemen
picked
then
for
their
looks
as
well
as
their
proclivities
the
color
of
cinders
and
ash
about
them
and
the
continual
smell
of
burning
from
their
pipes
captain
beatty
there
rising
in
thunderheads
of
tobacco
smoke
beatty
opening
a
fresh
tobacco
packet
crumpling
the
cellophane
into
a
sound
of
fire
montag
looked
at
the
cards
in
his
own
hands
i
i
ve
been
thinking
about
the
fire
last
week
about
the
man
whose
library
we
fixed
what
happened
to
him
they
took
him
screaming
off
to
the
asylum
he
wasn
t
insane
beatty
arranged
his
cards
quietly
any
man
s
insane
who
thinks
he
can
fool
the
government
and
us
i
ve
tried
to
imagine
said
montag
just
how
it
would
feel
i
mean
to
have
firemen
burn
our
houses
and
our
books
we
haven
t
any
books
but
if
we
did
have
some
you
got
some
beatty
blinked
slowly
no
montag
gazed
beyond
them
to
the
wall
with
the
typed
lists
of
a
million
forbidden
books
their
names
leapt
in
fire
burning
down
the
years
under
his
axe
and
his
hose
which
sprayed
not
water
but
kerosene
no
but
in
his
mind
a
cool
wind
started
up
and
blew
out
the
ventilator
grill
at
home
softly
chilling
his
face
and
again
he
saw
himself
in
a
green
park
talking
to
an
old
man
a
very
old
man
and
the
wind
from
the
park
was
cold
too
montag
hesitated
what
was
it
always
like
this
the
firehouse
our
work
i
mean
well
once
upon
a
time
once
upon
a
time
beatty
said
what
kind
of
talk
is
that
fool
thought
montag
to
himself
you
ll
give
it
away
at
the
last
fire
a
book
of
fairy
tales
he
d
glanced
at
a
single
line
i
mean
he
said
in
the
old
days
before
homes
were
completely
fireproofed
suddenly
it
seemed
a
much
younger
voice
was
speaking
for
him
he
opened
his
mouth
and
it
was
clarisse
mcclellan
saying
didn
t
firemen
prevent
fires
rather
than
stoke
them
up
and
get
them
going
that
s
rich
stoneman
and
black
drew
forth
their
rule
books
which
also
contained
brief
histories
of
the
firemen
of
america
and
laid
them
out
where
montag
though
long
familiar
with
them
might
read:

4
report
back
to
firehouse
immediately
5
stand
alert
for
other
alarms
everyone
watched
montag
he
did
not
move
the
alarm
sounded
the
bell
in
the
ceiling
kicked
itself
two
hundred
times
suddenly
there
were
four
empty
chairs
the
cards
fell
in
a
flurry
of
snow
the
brass
pole
shivered
the
men
were
gone
montag
sat
in
his
chair
below
the
orange
dragon
coughed
to
life
montag
slid
down
the
pole
like
a
man
in
a
dream
the
mechanical
hound
leapt
up
in
its
kennel
its
eyes
all
green
flame
montag
you
forgot
your
helmet
he
seized
it
off
the
wall
behind
him
ran
leapt
and
they
were
off
the
night
wind
hammering
about
their
siren
scream
and
their
mighty
metal
thunder
it
was
a
flaking
three
story
house
in
the
ancient
part
of
the
city
a
century
old
if
it
was
a
day
but
like
all
houses
it
had
been
given
a
thin
fireproof
plastic
sheath
many
years
ago
and
this
preservative
shell
seemed
to
be
the
only
thing
holding
it
in
the
sky
here
we
are
the
engine
slammed
to
a
stop
beatty
stoneman
and
black
ran
up
the
sidewalk
suddenly
odious
and
fat
in
their
plump
fireproof
slickers
montag
followed
they
crashed
the
front
door
and
grabbed
at
a
woman
though
she
was
not
"running;"
she
was
not
trying
to
escape
she
was
only
standing
weaving
from
side
to
side
her
eyes
fixed
upon
a
nothingness
in
the
wall
as
if
they
had
struck
her
a
terrible
blow
upon
the
head
her
tongue
was
moving
in
her
mouth
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
trying
to
remember
something
and
then
they
remembered
and
her
tongue
moved
again:
play
the
man
master
"ridley;"
we
shall
this
day
light
such
a
candle
by
god
s
grace
in
england
as
i
trust
shall
never
be
put
out
u
enough
of
that
said
beatty
where
are
they
he
slapped
her
face
with
amazing
objectivity
and
repeated
the
question
the
old
woman
s
eyes
came
to
a
focus
upon
beatty
you
know
where
they
are
or
you
wouldn
t
be
here
she
said
stoneman
held
out
the
telephone
alarm
card
with
the
complaint
signed
in
telephone
duplicate
on
the
back:
have
reason
to
suspect

my

said
the
woman
reading
the
initials
all
right
men
let
s
get
em
next
thing
they
were
up
in
musty
blackness
swinging
silver
hatchets
at
doors
that
were
after
all
unlocked
tumbling
through
like
boys
all
rollick
and
shout
hey
a
fountain
of
books
sprang
down
upon
montag
as
he
climbed
shuddering
up
the
sheer
stairwell
how
inconvenient
always
before
it
had
been
like
snuffing
a
candle
the
police
went
first
and
adhesive
taped
the
victim
s
mouth
and
bandaged
him
off
into
their
glittering
beetle
cars
so
when
you
arrived
you
found
an
empty
house
you
weren
t
hurting
anyone
you
were
hurting
only
things
and
since
things
really
couldn
t
be
hurt
since
things
felt
nothing
and
things
don
t
scream
or
whimper
as
this
woman
might
begin
to
scream
and
cry
out
there
was
nothing
to
tease
your
conscience
later
you
were
simply
cleaning
up
janitorial
work
essentially
everything
to
its
proper
place
quick
with
the
kerosene
who
s
got
a
match
but
now
tonight
someone
had
slipped
this
woman
was
spoiling
the
ritual
the
men
were
making
too
much
noise
laughing
joking
to
cover
her
terrible
accusing
silence
below
she
made
the
empty
rooms
roar
with
accusation
and
shake
down
a
fine
dust
of
guilt
that
was
sucked
in
their
nostrils
as
they
plunged
about
it
was
neither
cricket
nor
correct
montag
felt
an
immense
irritation
she
shouldn
t
be
here
on
top
of
everything
books
bombarded
his
shoulders
his
arms
his
upturned
face
a
book
lit
almost
obediently
like
a
white
pigeon
in
his
hands
wings
fluttering
in
the
dim
wavering
light
a
page
hung
open
and
it
was
like
a
snowy
feather
the
words
delicately
painted
thereon
in
all
the
rush
and
fervor
montag
had
only
an
instant
to
read
a
line
but
it
blazed
in
his
mind
for
the
next
minute
as
if
stamped
there
with
fiery
steel
time
has
fallen
asleep
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
he
dropped
the
book
immediately
another
fell
into
his
arms
montag
up
here
montag
s
hand
closed
like
a
mouth
crushed
the
book
with
wild
devotion
with
an
insanity
of
mindlessness
to
his
chest
the
men
above
were
hurling
shovelfuls
of
magazines
into
the
dusty
air
they
fell
like
slaughtered
birds
and
the
woman
stood
below
like
a
small
girl
among
the
bodies
montag
had
done
nothing
his
hand
had
done
it
all
his
hand
with
a
brain
of
its
own
with
a
conscience
and
a
curiosity
in
each
trembling
finger
had
turned
thief
now
it
plunged
the
book
back
under
his
arm
pressed
it
tight
to
sweating
armpit
rushed
out
empty
with
a
magician
s
flourish
look
here
innocent
look
he
gazed
shaken
at
that
white
hand
he
held
it
way
out
as
if
he
were
farsighted
he
held
it
close
as
if
he
were
blind
montag
he
jerked
about
don
t
stand
there
idiot
the
books
lay
like
great
mounds
of
fishes
left
to
dry
the
men
danced
and
slipped
and
fell
over
them
titles
glittered
their
golden
eyes
falling
gone
kerosene
they
pumped
the
cold
fluid
from
the
numeraled
451
tanks
strapped
to
their
shoulders
they
coated
each
book
they
pumped
rooms
full
of
it
they
hurried
downstairs
montag
staggering
after
them
in
the
kerosene
fumes
come
on
woman
the
woman
knelt
among
the
books
touching
the
drenched
leather
and
cardboard
reading
the
gilt
titles
with
her
fingers
while
her
eyes
accused
montag
you
can
t
ever
have
my
books
she
said
you
know
the
law
said
beatty
where
s
your
common
sense
none
of
those
books
agree
with
each
other
you
ve
been
locked
up
here
for
years
with
a
regular
damned
tower
of
babel
snap
out
of
it
the
people
in
those
books
never
lived
come
on
now
she
shook
her
head
the
whole
house
is
going
up
said
beatty
the
men
walked
clumsily
to
the
door
they
glanced
back
at
montag
who
stood
near
the
woman
you
re
not
leaving
her
here
he
protested
she
won
t
come
force
her
then
beatty
raised
his
hand
in
which
was
concealed
the
igniter
we
re
due
back
at
the
house
besides
these
fanatics
always
try
"suicide;"
the
pattern
s
familiar
montag
placed
his
hand
on
the
woman
s
elbow
you
can
come
with
me
no
she
said
thank
you
anyway
i
m
counting
to
ten
said
beatty
one
two
please
said
montag
go
on
said
the
woman
three
four
here
montag
pulled
at
the
woman
the
woman
replied
quietly
i
want
to
stay
here
five
six
you
can
stop
counting
she
said
she
opened
the
fingers
of
one
hand
slightly
and
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
was
a
single
slender
object
an
ordinary
kitchen
match
the
sight
of
it
rushed
the
men
out
and
down
away
from
the
house
captain
beatty
keeping
his
dignity
backed
slowly
through
the
front
door
his
pink
face
burnt
and
shiny
from
a
thousand
fires
and
night
excitements
god
thought
montag
how
true
always
at
night
the
alarm
comes
never
by
day
is
it
because
fire
is
prettier
by
night
more
spectacle
a
better
show
the
pink
face
of
beatty
now
showed
the
faintest
panic
in
the
door
the
woman
s
hand
twitched
on
the
single
matchstick
the
fumes
of
kerosene
bloomed
up
about
her
montag
felt
the
hidden
book
pound
like
a
heart
against
his
chest
go
on
said
the
woman
and
montag
felt
himself
back
away
and
away
out
the
door
after
beatty
down
the
steps
across
the
lawn
where
the
path
of
kerosene
lay
like
the
track
of
some
evil
snail
on
the
front
porch
where
she
had
come
to
weigh
them
quietly
with
her
eyes
her
quietness
a
condemnation
the
woman
stood
motionless
beatty
flicked
his
fingers
to
spark
the
kerosene
he
was
too
late
montag
gasped
the
woman
on
the
porch
reached
out
with
contempt
to
them
all
and
struck
the
kitchen
match
against
the
railing
people
ran
out
of
houses
all
down
the
street
they
said
nothing
on
their
way
back
to
the
firehouse
nobody
looked
at
anyone
else
montag
sat
in
the
front
seat
with
beatty
and
black
they
did
not
even
smoke
their
pipes
they
sat
there
looking
out
the
front
of
the
great
salamander
as
they
turned
a
corner
and
went
silently
on
master
ridley
said
montag
at
last

said

ridley

said

crazy
thing
when

in
the
door

the
man

said

put
out
said
beatty
stoneman
glanced
over
at
the
captain
as
did
montag
startled
beatty
rubbed
his
chin
a
man
named
latimer
said
that
to
a
man
named
nicholas
ridley
as
they
were
being
burnt
alive
at

montag
and
stoneman
went
back
to
looking
at
the
street
as
it
moved
under
the
engine
wheels
i
m
full
of
bits
and
pieces
said
beatty
most
fire
captains

to
be
sometimes
i
surprise

watch
it
stoneman
stoneman
braked
the
truck
damn
said
beatty
you
ve
gone
right
by
the
corner
where
we
turn
for
the
firehouse
who
is
it
who
would
it
be
said
montag
leaning
back
against
the
closed
door
in
the
dark
his
wife
said
at
last
well
put
on
the
light
i
don
t
want
the
light
come
to
bed
he
heard
her
roll
"impatiently;"
the
bedsprings
squealed
are
you
drunk
she
said
so
it
was
the
hand
that
started
it
all
he
felt
one
hand
and
then
the
other
work
his
coat
free
and
let
it
slump
to
the
floor
he
held
his
pants
out
into
an
abyss
and
let
them
fall
into
darkness
his
hands
had
been
infected
and
soon
it
would
be
his
arms
he
could
feel
the
poison
working
up
his
wrists
and
into
his
elbows
and
his
shoulders
and
then
the
jump
over
from
shoulder
blade
to
shoulder
blade
like
a
spark
leaping
a
gap
his
hands
were
ravenous
and
his
eyes
were
beginning
to
feel
hunger
as
if
they
must
look
at
something
anything
everything
his
wife
said
what
are
you
doing
&nbs
"p;"
he
balanced
in
space
with
the
book
in
his
sweating
cold
fingers
a
minute
later
she
said
well
just
don
t
stand
there
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
he
made
a
small
sound
what
she
asked
he
made
more
soft
sounds
he
stumbled
toward
the
bed
and
shoved
the
book
clumsily
under
the
cold
pillow
he
fell
into
bed
and
his
wife
cried
out
startled
he
lay
far
across
the
room
from
her
on
a
winter
island
separated
by
an
empty
sea
she
talked
to
him
for
what
seemed
a
long
while
and
she
talked
about
this
and
she
talked
about
that
and
it
was
only
words
like
the
words
he
had
heard
once
in
a
nursery
at
a
friend
s
house
a
two
year
old
child
building
word
patterns
talking
jargon
making
pretty
sounds
in
the
air
but
montag
said
nothing
and
after
a
long
while
when
he
only
made
the
small
sounds
he
felt
her
move
in
the
room
and
come
to
his
bed
and
stand
over
him
and
put
her
hand
down
to
feel
his
cheek
he
knew
that
when
she
pulled
her
hand
away
from
his
face
it
was
wet
late
in
the
night
he
looked
over
at
mildred
she
was
awake
there
was
a
tiny
dance
of
melody
in
the
air
her
seashell
was
tamped
in
her
ear
again
and
she
was
listening
to
far
people
in
far
places
her
eyes
wide
and
staring
at
the
fathoms
of
blackness
above
her
in
the
ceiling
wasn
t
there
an
old
joke
about
the
wife
who
talked
so
much
on
the
telephone
that
her
desperate
husband
ran
out
to
the
nearest
store
and
telephoned
her
to
ask
what
was
for
dinner
well
then
why
didn
t
he
buy
himself
an
audio
seashell
broadcasting
station
and
talk
to
his
wife
late
at
night
murmur
whisper
shout
scream
yell
but
what
would
he
whisper
what
would
he
yell
what
could
he
say
and
suddenly
she
was
so
strange
he
couldn
t
believe
he
knew
her
at
all
he
was
in
someone
else
s
house
like
those
other
jokes
people
told
of
the
gentleman
drunk
coming
home
late
late
at
night
unlocking
the
wrong
door
entering
a
wrong
room
and
bedding
with
a
stranger
and
getting
up
early
and
going
to
work
and
neither
of
them
the
wiser
millie
he
whispered
what
i
didn
t
mean
to
startle
you
what
i
want
to
know
is
well
when
did
we
meet
and
where
when
did
we
meet
for
what
she
asked
i
mean
originally
he
knew
she
must
be
frowning
in
the
dark
he
clarified
it
the
first
time
we
ever
met
where
was
it
and
when
why
it
was
at
she
stopped
i
don
t
know
she
said
he
was
cold
can
t
you
remember
it
s
been
so
long
only
ten
years
that
s
all
only
ten
don
t
get
excited
i
m
trying
to
think
she
laughed
an
odd
little
laugh
that
went
up
and
up
funny
how
funny
not
to
remember
where
or
when
you
met
your
husband
or
wife
he
lay
massaging
his
eyes
his
brow
and
the
back
of
his
neck
slowly
he
held
both
hands
over
his
eyes
and
applied
a
steady
pressure
there
as
if
to
crush
memory
into
place
it
was
suddenly
more
important
than
any
other
thing
in
a
lifetime
that
he
know
where
he
had
met
mildred
it
doesn
t
matter
she
was
up
in
the
bathroom
now
and
he
heard
the
water
running
and
the
swallowing
sound
she
made
no
i
guess
not
he
said
he
tried
to
count
how
many
times
she
swallowed
and
he
thought
of
the
visit
from
the
two
zinc
oxide
faced
men
with
the
cigarettes
in
their
straight
lined
mouths
and
the
electronic
eyed
snake
winding
down
into
the
layer
upon
layer
of
night
and
stone
and
stagnant
spring
water
and
he
wanted
to
call
out
to
her
how
many
have
you
taken
tonight
the
capsules
how
many
will
you
take
later
and
not
know
and
so
on
every
hour
or
maybe
not
tonight
tomorrow
night
and
me
not
sleeping
tonight
or
tomorrow
night
or
any
night
for
a
long
while
now
that
this
has
started
and
he
thought
of
her
lying
on
the
bed
with
the
two
technicians
standing
straight
over
her
not
bent
with
concern
but
only
standing
straight
arms
folded
and
he
remembered
thinking
then
that
if
she
died
he
was
certain
he
wouldn
t
cry
for
it
would
be
the
dying
of
an
unknown
a
street
face
a
newspaper
image
and
it
was
suddenly
so
very
wrong
that
he
had
begun
to
cry
not
at
death
but
at
the
thought
of
not
crying
at
death
a
silly
empty
man
near
a
silly
empty
woman
while
the
hungry
snake
made
her
still
more
empty
how
do
you
get
so
empty
he
wondered
who
takes
it
out
of
you
and
that
awful
flower
the
other
day
the
dandelion
it
had
summed
up
everything
hadn
t
it
what
a
shame
you
re
not
in
love
with
anyone
and
why
not
well
wasn
t
there
a
wall
between
him
and
mildred
when
you
came
down
to
it
literally
not
just
one
wall
but
so
far
three
and
expensive
too
and
the
uncles
the
aunts
the
cousins
the
nieces
the
nephews
that
lived
in
those
walls
the
gibbering
pack
of
tree
apes
that
said
nothing
nothing
nothing
and
said
it
loud
loud
loud
he
had
taken
to
calling
them
relatives
from
the
very
first
how
s
uncle
louis
today
who
and
aunt
maude
the
most
significant
memory
he
had
of
mildred
really
was
of
a
little
girl
in
a
forest
without
trees
how
odd
or
rather
a
little
girl
lost
on
a
plateau
where
there
used
to
be
trees
you
could
feel
the
memory
of
their
shapes
all
about
sitting
in
the
center
of
the
living
room
the
living
"room;"
what
a
good
job
of
labeling
that
was
now
no
matter
when
he
came
in
the
walls
were
always
talking
to
mildred
something
must
be
done
yes
something
must
be
done
well
let
s
not
stand
and
talk
let
s
do
it
i
m
so
mad
i
could
spit
what
was
it
all
about
mildred
couldn
t
say
who
was
mad
at
whom
mildred
didn
t
quite
know
what
were
they
going
to
do
well
said
mildred
wait
around
and
see
he
had
waited
around
to
see
a
great
thunderstorm
of
sound
gushed
from
the
walls
music
bombarded
him
at
such
an
immense
volume
that
his
bones
were
almost
shaken
from
their
"tendons;"
he
felt
his
jaw
vibrate
his
eyes
wobble
in
his
head
he
was
a
victim
of
concussion
when
it
was
all
over
he
felt
like
a
man
who
had
been
thrown
from
a
cliff
whirled
in
a
centrifuge
and
spat
out
over
a
waterfall
that
fell
and
fell
into
emptiness
and
emptiness
and
never
quite
touched
bottom
never
never
quite
no
not
quite
touched
bottom
and
you
fell
so
fast
you
didn
t
touch
the
sides
either
never
quite
touched
anything
the
thunder
faded
the
music
died
there
said
mildred
and
it
was
indeed
remarkable
something
had
happened
even
though
the
people
in
the
walls
of
the
room
had
barely
moved
and
nothing
had
really
been
settled
you
had
the
impression
that
someone
had
turned
on
a
washing
machine
or
sucked
you
up
in
a
gigantic
vacuum
you
drowned
in
music
and
pure
cacophony
he
came
out
of
the
room
sweating
and
on
the
point
of
collapse
behind
him
mildred
sat
in
her
chair
and
the
voices
went
on
again:
well
everything
will
be
all
right
now
said
an
aunt
oh
don
t
be
too
sure
said
a
cousin
now
don
t
get
angry
who
s
angry
you
are
i
am
you
re
mad
why
would
i
be
mad
because
that
s
all
very
well
cried
montag
but
what
are
they
mad
about
who
are
these
people
who
s
that
man
and
who
s
that
woman
are
they
husband
and
wife
are
they
divorced
engaged
what
good
god
nothing
s
connected
up
they
said
mildred
well
they
they
had
this
fight
you
see
they
certainly
fight
a
lot
you
should
listen
i
think
they
re
married
yes
they
re
married
why
and
if
it
was
not
the
three
walls
soon
to
be
four
walls
and
the
dream
complete
then
it
was
the
open
car
and
mildred
driving
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
across
town
he
shouting
at
her
and
she
shouting
back
and
both
trying
to
hear
what
was
said
but
hearing
only
the
scream
of
the
car
at
least
keep
it
down
to
the
minimum
he
yelled
what
she
cried
keep
it
down
to
fifty
five
the
minimum
he
shouted
the
what
she
shrieked
speed
he
shouted
and
she
pushed
it
up
to
one
hundred
and
five
miles
an
hour
and
tore
the
breath
from
his
mouth
when
they
stepped
out
of
the
car
she
had
the
seashells
stuffed
in
her
ears
silence
only
the
wind
blowing
softly
mildred
he
stirred
in
bed
he
reached
over
and
pulled
the
tiny
musical
insect
out
of
her
ear
mildred
mildred
yes
her
voice
was
faint
he
felt
he
was
one
of
the
creatures
electronically
inserted
between
the
slots
of
the
phono
color
walls
speaking
but
the
speech
not
piercing
the
crystal
barrier
he
could
only
pantomime
hoping
she
would
turn
his
way
and
see
him
they
could
not
touch
through
the
glass
mildred
do

know
that
girl
i
was
telling
you
about
what
girl
she

he
said
quietly
lying
there
they
lay
there
in
the
dark
room
not
moving
either
of
them
good
night
she
said
he
heard
a
faint
rustle
her
hand
moved
the
electric
thimble
moved
like
a
praying
mantis
on
the
pillow
touched
by
her
hand
now
it
was
in
her
ear
again
humming
he
listened
and
his
wife
was
singing
under
her
breath
outside
the
house
a
shadow
moved
an
autumn
wind
rose
up
and
faded
away
but
there
was
something
else
in
the
silence
that
he
heard
it
was
like
a
breath
exhaled
upon
the
window
it
was
like
a
faint
drift
of
greenish
luminescent
smoke
the
motion
of
a
single
huge
october
leaf
blowing
across
the
lawn
and
away
the
hound
he
thought
it
s
out
there
tonight
it
s
out
there
now
if
i
opened
the
window
he
did
not
open
the
window
he
had
chills
and
fever
in
the
morning
you
can
t
be
sick
said
mildred
he
closed
his
eyes
over
the
hotness
yes
but
you
were
all
right
last
night
no
i
wasn
t
all
right
he
heard
the
relatives
shouting
in
the
parlor
mildred
stood
over
his
bed
curiously
he
felt
her
there
he
saw
her
without
opening
his
eyes
her
hair
burnt
by
chemicals
to
a
brittle
straw
her
eyes
with
a
kind
of
cataract
unseen
but
suspect
far
behind
the
pupils
the
reddened
pouting
lips
the
body
as
thin
as
a
praying
mantis
from
dieting
and
her
flesh
like
white
bacon
he
could
remember
her
no
other
way
will
you
bring
me
aspirin
and
water
you
ve
got
to
get
up
she
said
it
s
noon

slept
five
hours
later
than
usual

you
turn
the
parlor
off
he
asked
that
s
my
family
will
you
turn
it
off
for
a
sick
man
i
ll
turn
it
down
she
went
out
of
the
room
and
did
nothing
to
the
parlor
and
came
back
is
that
better
thanks
that
s
my
favorite
program
she
said
what
about
the
aspirin
you
ve
never
been
sick
before
she
went
away
again
well
i
m
sick
now
i
m

going
to
work
tonight
call
beatty
for
me
you
acted
funny
last
night
she
returned
humming
where
s
the
aspirin
he
glanced
at
the
water
glass
she
handed
him
oh
she
walked
to
the
bath
again
did
something
happen
a
fire
is
all
i
had
a
nice
evening
she
said
in
the
bathroom
what
doing
the
parlor
what
was
on
programs
what
programs
some
of
the
best
ever
who
oh
you
know
the
bunch
yes
the
bunch
the
bunch
the
bunch
he
pressed
at
the
pain
in
his
eyes
and
suddenly
the
odor
of
kerosene
made
him
vomit
mildred
came
in
humming
she
was
surprised
why
d
you
do
that
he
looked
with
dismay
at
the
floor
we
burned
an
old
woman
with
her
books
it
s
a
good
thing
the
rug
s
washable
she
fetched
a
mop
and
worked
on
it
i
went
to
helen
s
last
night
couldn
t
you
get
the
shows
in
your
own
parlor

but
it

nice
visiting
she
went
out
into
the
parlor
he
heard
her
singing
mildred
he
called
she
returned
singing
snapping
her
fingers
softly
aren
t
you
going
to
ask
me
about
last
night
he
said
what
about
it
we
burned
a
thousand
books
we
burned
a
woman
well
the
parlor
was
exploding
with
sound
we
burned
copies
of
dante
and
swift
and
marcus
aurelius
wasn
t
he
a
european
something
like
that
wasn
t
he
a
radical
i
never
read
him
he
was
a
radical
mildred
fiddled
with
the
telephone
you
don
t
expect
me
to
call
captain
beatty
do
you
you
must
don
t
shout
i
wasn
t
shouting
he
was
up
in
bed
suddenly
enraged
and
flushed
shaking
the
parlor
roared
in
the
hot
air
i
can
t
call
him
i
can
t
tell
him
i
m
sick
why
because
you
re
afraid
he
thought
a
child
feigning
illness
afraid
to
call
because
after
a
moment
s
discussion
the
conversation
would
run
so:
yes
captain
i
feel
better
already
i
ll
be
in
at
ten
o
clock
tonight
you
re
not
sick
said
mildred
montag
fell
back
in
bed
he
reached
under
his
pillow
the
hidden
book
was
still
there
mildred
how
would
it
be
if
well
maybe
i
quit
my
job
awhile
you
want
to
give
up
everything
after
all
these
years
of
working
because
one
night
some
woman
and
her
books
you
should
have
seen
her
millie
she
s
nothing
to
"me;"
she
shouldn
t
have
had
books
it
was
her
responsibility
she
should
ve
thought
of
that
i
hate
her
she
s
got
you
going
and
next
thing
you
know
we
ll
be
out
no
house
no
job
nothing
you
weren
t
there
you
didn
t
see
he
said
there
must
be
something
in
books
things
we
can
t
imagine
to
make
a
woman
stay
in
a
burning
"house;"
there
must
be
something
there
you
don
t
stay
for
nothing
she
was
simple
minded
she
was
as
rational
as
you
and
i
more
so
perhaps
and
we
burned
her
that
s
water
under
the
bridge
no
not
"water;"
fire
you
ever
seen
a
burned
house
it
smolders
for
days
well
this
fire
ll
last
me
the
rest
of
my
life
god
i
ve
been
trying
to
put
it
out
in
my
mind
all
night
i
m
crazy
with
trying
you
should
ve
thought
of
that
before
becoming
a
fireman
thought
he
said
was
i
given
a
choice
my
grandfather
and
father
were
firemen
in
my
sleep
i
ran
after
them
the
parlor
was
playing
a
dance
tune
this
is
the
day
you
go
on
the
early
shift
said
mildred
you
should
ve
gone
two
hours
ago
i
just
noticed
it
s
not
just
the
woman
that
died
said
montag
last
night
i
thought
about
all
that
kerosene
i
ve
used
in
the
past
ten
years
and
i
thought
about
books
and
for
the
first
time
i
realized
that
a
man
was
behind
each
one
of
the
books
a
man
had
to
think
them
up
a
man
had
to
take
a
long
time
to
put
them
down
on
paper
and
i
d
never
even
thought
that
thought
before
he
got
out
of
bed
it
took
some
man
a
lifetime
maybe
to
put
some
of
his
thoughts
down
looking
around
at
the
world
and
life
and
then
i
come
along
in
two
minutes
and
boom
it
s
all
over
let
me
alone
said
mildred
i
didn
t
do
anything
let
you
alone
that
s
all
very
well
but
how
can
i
leave
myself
alone
we
need
not
to
be
let
alone
we
need
to
be
really
bothered
once
in
a
while
how
long
is
it
since
you
were
really
bothered
about
something
important
about
something
real
and
then
he
shut
up
for
he
remembered
last
week
and
the
two
white
stones
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
and
the
pump
snake
with
the
probing
eye
and
the
two
soap
faced
men
with
the
cigarettes
moving
in
their
mouths
when
they
talked
but
that
was
another
mildred
that
was
a
mildred
so
deep
inside
this
one
and
so
bothered
really
bothered
that
the
two
women
had
never
met
he
turned
away
mildred
said
well
now
you
ve
done
it
out
front
of
the
house
look
who
s
here
i
don
t
care
there
s
a
phoenix
car
just
drove
up
and
a
man
in
a
black
shirt
with
an
orange
snake
stitched
on
his
arm
coming
up
the
front
walk
captain
beatty
he
said
captain
beatty
montag
did
not
move
but
stood
looking
into
the
cold
whiteness
of
the
wall
immediately
before
him
go
let
him
in
will
you
tell
him
i
m
sick
tell
him
yourself
she
ran
a
few
steps
this
way
a
few
steps
that
and
stopped
eyes
wide
when
the
front
door
speaker
called
her
name
softly
softly
mrs
montag
mrs
montag
someone
here
someone
here
mrs
montag
mrs
montag
someone
s
here
fading
montag
made
sure
the
book
was
well
hidden
behind
the
pillow
climbed
slowly
back
into
bed
arranged
the
covers
over
his
knees
and
across
his
chest
half
sitting
and
after
a
while
mildred
moved
and
went
out
of
the
room
and
captain
beatty
strolled
in
his
hands
in
his
pockets
shut
the
relatives
up
said
beatty
looking
around
at
everything
except
montag
and
his
wife
this
time
mildred
ran
the
yammering
voices
stopped
yelling
in
the
parlor
captain
beatty
sat
down
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
with
a
peaceful
look
on
his
ruddy
face
he
took
time
to
prepare
and
light
his
brass
pipe
and
puff
out
a
great
smoke
cloud
just
thought
i
d
come
by
and
see
how
the
sick
man
is
how
d
you
guess
beatty
smiled
his
smile
which
showed
the
candy
pink
ness
of
his
gums
and
the
tiny
candy
whiteness
of
his
teeth
i
ve
seen
it
all
you
were
going
to
call
for
a
night
off
montag
sat
in
bed
well
said
beatty
take
the
night
off
he
examined
his
eternal
matchbox
the
lid
of
which
said
guaranteed:
one
million
lights
in
this
igniter
a
nd
began
to
strike
the
chemical
match
abstractedly
blow
out
strike
blow
out

a
few
words
blow
out
he
looked
at
the
flame
he
blew
he
looked
at
the
smoke
when
will
you
be
well
tomorrow
the
next
day
maybe
first
of
the
week
beatty
puffed
his
pipe
every
fireman
sooner
or
later
hits
this
they
only
need
understanding
to
know
how
the
wheels
run
need
to
know
the
history
of
our
profession
they
don
t
feed
it
to
rookies
like
they
used
to
damn
shame
puff
only
fire
chiefs
remember
it
now
puff
i
ll
let
you
in
on
it
mildred
fidgeted
beatty
took
a
full
minute
to
settle
himself
in
and
think
back
for
what
he
wanted
to
say
when
did
it
all
start
you
ask
this
job
of
ours
how
did
it
come
about
where
when
well
i
d
say
it
really
got
started
around
about
a
thing
called
the
civil
war
even
though
our
rule
book
claims
it
was
founded
earlier
the
fact
is
we
didn
t
get
along
well
until
photography
came
into
its
own
then
motion
pictures
in
the
early
twentieth
century
radio
television
things
began
to
have
mass
montag
sat
in
bed
not
moving
and
because
they
had
mass
they
became
simpler
said
beatty
once
books
appealed
to
a
few
people
here
there
everywhere
they
could
afford
to
be
different
the
world
was
roomy
but
then
the
world
got
full
of
eyes
and
elbows
and
mouths
double
triple
quadruple
population
films
and
radios
magazines
books
leveled
down
to
a
sort
of
paste
pudding
norm
do
you
follow
me
i
think
so
beatty
peered
at
the
smoke
pattern
he
had
put
out
on
the
air
picture

his

then
cut
again
to
fill
a
two
minute
book
column
winding
up
at
last
as
a
ten

twelve
line
dictionary
resume
i
exaggerate
of
course
the
dictionaries
were
for
reference
but
many
were
those
whose
sole
knowledge
of
hamlet
you
know
the
title
certainly
"montag;"
it
is
probably
only
a
faint
rumor
of
a
title
to
you
mrs
montag
whose
sole
knowledge
as
i
say
of
hamlet
was
a
one
page
digest
in
a
book
that
claimed:
now
at
last
you
can
read
all
the
"classics;"
keep
up
with
your
neighbors
do
you
see
out
of
the

into

college
and
back
to

"nursery;"
there
s
your
intellectual

for
the
past
five
centuries
or
more
mildred
arose
and
began
to
move
around
the
room
picking
things
up
and
putting
them
down
beatty
ignored
her
and
continued:

mildred
smoothed
the
bedclothes
montag
felt
his
heart
jump
and
jump
again
as
she
patted
his
pillow
right
now
she
was
pulling
at
his
shoulder
to
try
to
get
him
to
move
so
she
could
take
the
pillow
out
and
fix
it
nicely
and
put
it
back
and
perhaps
cry
out
and
stare
or
simply
reach
down
her
hand
and
say
what
s

said
mildred
no
whispered
montag
the
zipper
displaces
the
button
and
a
man
lacks
just
that
much
time
to
think
while
dressing
at
dawn
a
philosophical
hour
and
thus
a
melancholy
hour
mildred
said
here
get

montag
passionately
beatty
opened
his
eyes
wide
mildred
s
hand
had
frozen
behind
the
pillow
her
fingers
were
tracing
the
book
s
outline
and
as
the
shape
became
familiar
her
face
looked
surprised
and
then
stunned
her
mouth
opened
to
ask
a
question
empty
the
theaters
save
for
clowns
and
furnish
the
rooms
with
glass
walls
and
pretty
colors
running
up

down

like

or

you
like

you
montag
baseball
s
a
fine

now
beatty
was
almost
invisible
a
voice
somewhere
behind
a
screen
of
smoke
what
s
this
asked
mildred
almost
with
delight
montag
heaved
back
against
her
arms
what
s
this
here
sit
down
montag
shouted
she
jumped
away
her
hands
empty
we
re
talking
beatty
went
on
as
if
nothing

you

slammed

the

the

remember
that
all
the

minor
minorities
with
their
navels
to
be
kept
clean
authors
full
of
evil
thoughts
lock
up
your
typewriters
they
did
magazines
became
a
nice
blend
of
vanilla
tapioca
books
so
the
damned
snobbish
critics
said
were
dishwater
no
wonder
books
stopped
selling
the
critics
said
but
the
public
knowing
what
it
wanted
spinning
happily
let
the
comic
books
survive
and
the
three
dimensional
sex
magazines
of
course
there
you
have
it
montag
it
didn
t
come
from
the
government
down
there
was
no
dictum
no
declaration
no
censorship
to
start
with
no
technology
mass
exploitation
and
minority
pressure
carried
the
trick
thank
god
today
thanks
to
them
you
can
stay
happy
all
the
time
you
are
allowed
to
read
comics
the
good
old
confessions
or
trade
journals
yes
but
what
about
the
firemen
then
asked
montag
ah
beatty
leaned
forward
in
the
faint
mist
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
what
more
easily
explained
and
natural
with
school
turning
out
more
runners
jumpers
racers
tinkerers
grabbers
snatchers
fliers
and
swimmers
instead
of
examiners
critics
knowers
and
imaginative
creators
the
word
intellectual
of
course
became
the
swear
word
it
deserved
to
be
you
always
dread
the
unfamiliar
surely
you
remember
the
boy
in
your
own
school
class
who
was
exceptionally
bright
did
most
of
the
reciting
and
answering
while
the
others
sat
like
so
many
leaden
idols
hating
him
and
wasn
t
it
this
bright
boy
you
selected
for
beatings
and
tortures
after
hours
of
course
it
was
we
must
all
be
alike
not
everyone
born
free
and
equal
as
the
constitution
says
but
everyone
made
equal
each
man
the
image
of
every
"other;"
then
all
are
happy
for
there
are
no
mountains
to
make
them
cower
to
judge
themselves
against
so
a
book
is
a
loaded
gun
in
the
house
next
door
burn
it
take
the
shot
from
the
weapon
breach
man
s
mind
who
knows
who
might
be
the
target
of
the
well
read
man
me
i
won
t
stomach
them
for
a
minute
and
so
when
houses
were
finally
fireproofed
completely
all
over
the
world
you
were
correct
in
your
assumption
the
other
night
there
was
no
longer
need
of
firemen
for
the
old
purposes
they
were
given
the
new
job
as
custodians
of
our
peace
of
mind
the
focus
of
our
understandable
and
rightful
dread
of
being
"inferior;"
official
censors
judges
and
executors
that
s
you
montag
and
that
s
me
the
door
to
the
parlor
opened
and
mildred
stood
there
looking
in
at
them
looking
at
beatty
and
then
at
montag
behind
her
the
walls
of
the
room
were
flooded
with
green
and
yellow
and
orange
fireworks
sizzling
and
bursting
to
some
music
composed
almost
completely
of
trap
drums
tom
toms
and
cymbals
her
mouth
moved
and
she
was
saying
something
but
the
sound
covered
it
beatty
knocked
his
pipe
into
the
palm
of
his
pink
hand
studied
the
ashes
as
if
they
were
a
symbol
to
be
diagnosed
and
searched
for
meaning
you
must
understand
that
our
civilization
is
so
vast
that
we
can
t
have
our
minorities
upset
and
stirred
ask
yourself
what
do
we
want
in
this
country
above
all
people
want
to
be
happy
isn
t
that
right
haven
t
you
heard
it
all
your
life
i
want
to
be
happy
people
say
well
aren
t
they
don
t
we
keep
them
moving
don
t
we
give
them
fun
that
s
all
we
live
for
isn
t
it
for
pleasure
for
titillation
and
you
must
admit
our
culture
provides
plenty
of
these
yes
montag
could
lip
read
what
mildred
was
saying
in
the
doorway
he
tried
not
to
look
at
her
mouth
because
then
beatty
might
turn
and
read
what
was
there
too
colored
people
don
t
like
little
black
sambo
burn
it
white
people
don
t
feel
good
about
uncle
tom
s
cabin
burn
it
someone
s
written
a
book
on
tobacco
and
cancer
of
the
lungs
the
cigarette
people
are
weeping
burn
the
book
serenity
montag
peace
montag
take
your
fight
outside
better
yet
into
the
incinerator
funerals
are
unhappy
and
pagan
eliminate
them
too
five
minutes
after
a
person
is
dead
he
s
on
his
way
to
the
big
flue
the
incinerators
serviced
by
helicopters
all
over
the
country
ten
minutes
after
death
a
man
s
a
speck
of
black
dust
let
s
not
quibble
over
individuals
with
memoriams
forget
them
burn
all
burn
everything
fire
is
bright
and
fire
is
clean
the
fireworks
died
in
the
parlor
behind
mildred
she
had
stopped
talking
at
the
same
"time;"
a
miraculous
coincidence
montag
held
his
breath
there
was
a
girl
next
door
he
said
slowly
she
s
gone
now
i
think
dead
i
can
t
even
remember
her
face
but
she
was
different
how
how
did
she
happen
beatty
smiled
here
or
there
that
s
bound
to
occur
clarisse
mcclellan
we
ve
a
record
on
her
family
we
ve
watched
them
carefully
heredity
and
environment
are
funny
things
you
can
t
rid
yourselves
of
all
the
odd
ducks
in
just
a
few
years
the
home
environment
can
undo
a
lot
you
try
to
do
at
school
that
s
why
we
ve
lowered
the
kindergarten
age
year
after
year
until
now
we
re
almost
snatching
them
from
the
cradle
we
had
some
false
alarms
on
the
mcclellans
when
they
lived
in
chicago
never
found
a
book
uncle
had
a
mixed
"record;"
antisocial
the
girl
she
was
a
time
bomb
the
family
had
been
feeding
her
subconscious
i
m
sure
from
what
i
saw
of
her
school
record
she
didn
t
want
to
know
how
a
thing
was
done
but
why
that
can
be
embarrassing
you
ask
why
to
a
lot
of
things
and
you
wind
up
very
unhappy
indeed
if
you
keep
at
it
the
poor
girl
s
better
off
dead
yes
dead
luckily
queer
ones
like
her
don
t
happen
often
we
know
how
to
nip
most
of
them
in
the
bud
early
you
can
t
build
a
house
without
nails
and
wood
if
you
don
t
want
a
house
built
hide
the
nails
and
wood
if
you
don
t
want
a
man
unhappy
politically
don
t
give
him
two
sides
to
a
question
to
worry
"him;"
give
him
one
better
yet
give
him
none
let
him
forget
there
is
such
a
thing
as
war
if
the
government
is
inefficient
top
heavy
and
tax
mad
better
it
be
all
those
than
that
people
worry
over
it
peace
montag
give
the
people
contests
they
win
by
remembering
the
words
to
more
popular
songs
or
the
names
of
state
capitals
or
how
much
corn
iowa
grew
last
year
cram
them
full
of
noncombustible
data
chock
them
so
damned
full
of
facts
they
feel
stuffed
but
absolutely
brilliant
with
information
then
they
ll
feel
they
re
thinking
they
ll
get
a
sense
of
motion
without
moving
and
they
ll
be
happy
because
facts
of
that
sort
don
t
change
don
t
give
them
any
slippery
stuff
like
philosophy
or
sociology
to
tie
things
up
with
that
way
lies
melancholy
any
man
who
can
take
a
tv
wall
apart
and
put
it
back
together
again
and
most
men
can
nowadays
is
happier
than
any
man
who
tries
to
slide
rule
measure
and
equate
the
universe
which
just
won
t
be
measured
or
equated
without
making
man
feel
bestial
and
lonely
i
know
i
ve
tried
"it;"
to
hell
with
it
so
bring
on
your
clubs
and
parties
your
acrobats
and
magicians
your
daredevils
jet
cars
motorcycle
helicopters
your
sex
and
heroin
more
of
everything
to
do
with
automatic
reflex
if
the
drama
is
bad
if
the
film
says
nothing
if
the
play
is
hollow
sting
me
with
the
theremin
loudly
i
ll
think
i
m
responding
to
the
play
when
it
s
only
a
tactile
reaction
to
vibration
but
i
don
t
care
i
just
like
solid
entertainment
beatty
got
up
i
must
be
going
lecture
s
over
i
hope
i
ve
clarified
things
the
important
thing
for
you
to
remember
montag
is
we
re
the
happiness
boys
the
dixie
duo
you
and
i
and
the
others
we
stand
against
the
small
tide
of
those
who
want
to
make
everyone
unhappy
with
conflicting
theory
and
thought
we
have
our
fingers
in
the
dike
hold
steady
don
t
let
the
torrent
of
melancholy
and
drear
philosophy
drown
our
world
we
depend
on
you
i
don
t
think
you
realize
how
important
you
are
we
are
to
our
happy
world
as
it
stands
now
beatty
shook
montag
s
limp
hand
montag
still
sat
as
if
the
house
were
collapsing
about
him
and
he
could
not
move
in
the
bed
mildred
had
vanished
from
the
door
one
last
thing
said
beatty
at
least
once
in
his
career
every
fireman
gets
an
itch
what
do
the
books
say
he
wonders
oh
to
scratch
that
itch
eh
well
montag
take
my
word
for
it
i
ve
had
to
read
a
few
in
my
time
to
know
what
i
was
about
and
the
books
say
nothing
nothing
you
can
teach
or
believe
they
re
about
nonexistent
people
figments
of
imagination
if
they
re
fiction
and
if
they
re
nonfiction
it
s
worse
one
professor
calling
another
an
idiot
one
philosopher
screaming
down
another
s
gullet
all
of
them
running
about
putting
out
the
stars
and
extinguishing
the
sun
you
come
away
lost
well
then
what
if
a
fireman
accidentally
really
not
intending
anything
takes
a
book
home
with
him
montag
twitched
the
open
door
looked
at
him
with
its
great
vacant
eye
a
natural
error
curiosity
alone
said
beatty
we
don
t
get
overanxious
or
mad
we
let
the
fireman
keep
the
book
twenty
four
hours
if
he
hasn
t
burned
it
by
then
we
simply
come
burn
it
for
him
of
course
montag
s
mouth
was
dry
well
montag
will
you
take
another
later
shift
today
will
we
see
you
tonight
perhaps
i
don
t
know
said
montag
what
beatty
looked
faintly
surprised
montag
shut
his
eyes
i
ll
be
in
later
maybe
we
d
certainly
miss
you
if
you
didn
t
show
said
beatty
putting
his
pipe
in
his
pocket
thoughtfully
i
ll
never
come
in
again
thought
montag
get
well
and
keep
well
said
beatty
he
turned
and
went
out
through
the
open
door
montag
watched
through
the
window
as
beatty
drove
away
in
his
gleaming
yellow
flame
colored
beetle
with
the
black
char
colored
tires
across
the
street
and
down
the
way
the
other
houses
stood
with
their
flat
fronts
what
was
it
clarisse
had
said
one
afternoon
no
front
porches
my
uncle
says
there
used
to
be
front
porches
and
people
sat
there
sometimes
at
night
talking
when
they
wanted
to
talk
rocking
and
not
talking
when
they
didn
t
want
to
talk
sometimes
they
just
sat
there
and
thought
about
things
turned
things
over
my
uncle
says
the
architects
got
rid
of
the
front
porches
because
they
didn
t
look
well
but
my
uncle
says
that
was
merely
rationalizing
"it;"
the
real
reason
hidden
underneath
might
be
they
didn
t
want
people
sitting
like
that
doing
nothing
rocking
"talking;"
that
was
the
wrong
kind
of
social
life
people
talked
too
much
and
they
had
time
to
think
so
they
ran
off
with
the
porches
and
the
gardens
too
not
many
gardens
anymore
to
sit
around
in
and
look
at
the
furniture
no
rocking
chairs
anymore
they
re
too
comfortable
get
people
up
and
running
around
my
uncle
says
and
my
uncle
and
my
uncle
her
voice
faded
montag
turned
and
looked
at
his
wife
who
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
parlor
talking
to
an
announcer
who
in
turn
was
talking
to
her
mrs
montag
he
was
saying
this
that
and
the
other
mrs
montag
something
else
and
still
another
the
converter
attachment
which
had
cost
them
one
hundred
dollars
automatically
supplied
her
name
whenever
the
announcer
addressed
his
anonymous
audience
leaving
a
blank
where
the
proper
syllables
could
be
filled
in
a
special
spot
wavex
scrambler
also
caused
his
televised
image
in
the
area
immediately
about
his
lips
to
mouth
the
vowels
and
consonants
beautifully
he
was
a
friend
no
doubt
of
it
a
good
friend
mrs
montag
now
look
right
here
her
head
turned
though
she
quite
obviously
was
not
listening
montag
said
it
s
only
a
step
from
not
going
to
work
today
to
not
working
tomorrow
to
not
working
at
the
firehouse
ever
again
you
are
going
to
work
tonight
though
aren
t
you
said
mildred
i
haven
t
decided
right
now
i
ve
got
an
awful
feeling
i
want
to
smash
things
and
kill
things
go
take
the
beetle
no
thanks
the
keys
to
the
beetle
are
on
the
night
table
i
always
like
to
drive
fast
when
i
feel
that
way
you
get
it
up
around
ninety
five
and
you
feel
wonderful
sometimes
i
drive
all
night
and
come
back
and
you
don
t
know
it
it
s
fun
out
in
the
country
you
hit
rabbits
sometimes
you
hit
dogs
go
take
the
beetle
no
i
don
t
want
to
this
time
i
want
to
hold
onto
this
funny
thing
god
it
s
gotten
big
on
me
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
i
m
so
damned
unhappy
i
m
so
mad
and
i
don
t
know
why
i
feel
like
i
m
putting
on
weight
i
feel
fat
i
feel
like
i
ve
been
saving
up
a
lot
of
things
and
don
t
know
what
i
might
even
start
reading
books
they
d
put
you
in
jail
wouldn
t
they
she
looked
at
him
as
if
he
were
behind
the
glass
wall
he
began
to
put
on
his
clothes
moving
restlessly
about
the
bedroom
yes
and
it
might
be
a
good
idea
before
i
hurt
someone
did
you
hear
beatty
did
you
listen
to
him
he
knows
all
the
answers
he
s
right
happiness
is
important
fun
is
everything
and
yet
i
kept
sitting
there
saying
to
myself
i
m
not
happy
i
m
not
happy
i
am
mildred
s
mouth
beamed
and
proud
of
it
i
m
going
to
do
something
said
montag
i
don
t
even
know
what
yet
but
i
m
going
to
do
something
big
i
m
tired
of
listening
to
this
junk
said
mildred
turning
from
him
to
the
announcer
again
montag
touched
the
volume
control
in
the
wall
and
the
announcer
was
speechless
millie
he
paused
this
is
your
house
as
well
as
mine
i
feel
it
s
only
fair
that
i
tell
you
something
now
i
should
have
told
you
before
but
i
wasn
t
even
admitting
it
to
myself
i
have
something
i
want
you
to
see
something
i
ve
put
away
and
hid
during
the
past
year
now
and
again
once
in
a
while
i
didn
t
know
why
but
i
did
it
and
i
never
told
you
he
took
hold
of
a
straight
backed
chair
and
moved
it
slowly
and
steadily
into
the
hall
near
the
front
door
and
climbed
up
on
it
and
stood
for
a
moment
like
a
statue
on
a
pedestal
his
wife
standing
under
him
waiting
then
he
reached
up
and
pulled
back
the
grill
of
the
air
conditioning
system
and
reached
far
back
inside
to
the
right
and
moved
still
another
sliding
sheet
of
metal
and
took
out
a
book
without
looking
at
it
he
dropped
it
to
the
floor
he
put
his
hand
back
up
and
took
out
two
books
and
moved
his
hand
down
and
dropped
the
two
books
to
the
floor
he
kept
moving
his
hand
and
dropping
books
small
ones
fairly
large
ones
yellow
red
green
ones
when
he
was
done
he
looked
down
upon
some
twenty
books
lying
at
his
wife
s
feet
i
m
sorry
he
said
i
didn
t
really
think
but
now
it
looks
as
if
we
re
in
this
together
mildred
backed
away
as
if
she
were
suddenly
confronted
by
a
pack
of
mice
that
had
come
up
out
of
the
floor
he
could
hear
her
breathing
rapidly
and
her
face
was
paled
out
and
her
eyes
were
fastened
wide
she
said
his
name
over
twice
three
times
then
moaning
she
ran
forward
seized
a
book
and
ran
toward
the
kitchen
incinerator
he
caught
her
shrieking
he
held
her
and
she
tried
to
fight
away
from
him
scratching
no
millie
no
wait
stop
it
will
you
you
don
t
know
stop
it
he
slapped
her
face
he
grabbed
her
again
and
shook
her
she
said
his
name
and
began
to
cry
millie
he
said
listen
give
me
a
second
will
you
we
can
t
do
anything
we
can
t
burn
these
i
want
to
look
at
them
at
least
look
at
them
once
then
if
what
the
captain
says
is
true
we
ll
burn
them
together
believe
me
we
ll
burn
them
together
you
must
help
me
he
looked
down
into
her
face
and
took
hold
of
her
chin
and
held
her
firmly
he
was
looking
not
only
at
her
but
for
himself
and
what
he
must
do
in
her
face
whether
we
like
this
or
not
we
re
in
it
i
ve
never
asked
for
much
from
you
in
all
these
years
but
i
ask
it
now
i
plead
for
it
we
ve
got
to
start
somewhere
here
figuring
out
why
we
re
in
such
a
mess
you
and
the
medicine
nights
and
the
car
and
me
and
my
work
we
re
heading
right
for
the
cliff
millie
god
i
don
t
want
to
go
over
this
isn
t
going
to
be
easy
we
haven
t
anything
to
go
on
but
maybe
we
can
piece
it
out
and
figure
it
and
help
each
other
i
need
you
so
much
right
now
i
can
t
tell
you
if
you
love
me
at
all
you
ll
put
up
with
this
twenty
four
forty
eight
hours
that
s
all
i
ask
then
it
ll
be
over
i
promise
i
swear
and
if
there
is
something
here
just
one
little
thing
out
of
a
whole
mess
of
things
maybe
we
can
pass
it
on
to
someone
else
she
wasn
t
fighting
any
more
so
he
let
her
go
she
sagged
away
from
him
and
slid
down
the
wall
and
sat
on
the
floor
looking
at
the
books
her
foot
touched
one
and
she
saw
this
and
pulled
her
foot
away
that
woman
the
other
night
millie
you
weren
t
there
you
didn
t
see
her
face
and
clarisse
you
never
talked
to
her
i
talked
to
her
and
men
like
beatty
are
afraid
of
her
i
can
t
understand
it
why
should
they
be
so
afraid
of
someone
like
her
but
i
kept
putting
her
alongside
the
firemen
in
the
house
last
night
and
i
suddenly
realized
i
didn
t
like
them
at
all
and
i
didn
t
like
myself
at
all
any
more
and
i
thought
maybe
it
would
be
best
if
the
firemen
themselves
were
burnt
guy
the
front
door
voice
called
softly:
mrs
montag
mrs
montag
someone
here
someone
here
mrs
montag
mrs
montag
someone
here
softly
they
turned
to
the
stare
at
the
door
and
the
books
toppled
everywhere
everywhere
in
heaps
beatty
said
mildred
it
can
t
be
him
he
s
come
back
she
whispered
the
front
door
voiced
called
again
softly
someone
here
we
won
t
answer
montag
lay
back
against
the
wall
and
then
slowly
sank
to
a
crouching
position
and
began
to
nudge
the
books
bewilderedly
with
his
thumb
his
forefinger
he
was
shivering
and
he
wanted
above
all
to
shove
the
books
up
through
the
ventilator
again
but
he
knew
he
could
not
face
beatty
again
he
crouched
and
then
he
sat
and
the
voice
of
the
front
door
spoke
again
more
insistently
montag
picked
a
single
small
volume
from
the
floor
where
do
we
begin
he
opened
the
book
halfway
and
peered
at
it
we
begin
by
beginning
i
guess
he
ll
come
in
said
mildred
and
burn
us
and
the
books
the
front
door
voice
faded
at
last
there
was
a
silence
montag
felt
the
presence
of
someone
beyond
the
door
waiting
listening
then
the
footsteps
going
away
down
the
walk
and
over
the
lawn
let
s
see
what
this
is
said
montag
he
spoke
the
words
haltingly
and
with
a
terrible
self
consciousness
he
read
a
dozen
pages
here
or
there
and
came
at
last
to
this:
it
is
computed
that
eleven
thousand
persons
have
at
several
times
suffered
death
rather
than
submit
to
break
their
eggs
at
the
smaller
end
mildred
sat
across
the
hall
from
him
what
does
it
mean
it
doesn
t
mean
anything
the
captain
was
right
here
now
said
montag
we
ll
start
over
again
at
the
beginning
two
the
sieve
and
the
sand
they
read
the
long
afternoon
through
while
the
cold
november
rain
fell
from
the
sky
upon
the
quiet
house
they
sat
in
the
hall
because
the
parlor
was
so
empty
and
gray
looking
without
its
wall
lit
with
orange
and
yellow
confetti
and
skyrockets
and
women
in
gold
mesh
dresses
and
men
in
black
velvet
pulling
one
hundred
pound
rabbits
from
silver
hats
the
parlor
was
dead
and
mildred
kept
peering
in
at
it
with
a
blank
expression
as
montag
paced
the
floor
and
came
back
and
squatted
down
and
read
a
page
as
many
as
ten
times
aloud
we
cannot
tell
the
precise
moment
when
friendship
is
formed
as
in
filling
a
vessel
drop
by
drop
there
is
at
last
a
drop
which
makes
it
run
"over;"
so
in
a
series
of
kindnesses
there
is
at
least
one
which
makes
the
heart
run
over
montag
sat
listening
to
the
rain
is
that
what
it
was
in
the
girl
next
door
i
ve
tried
so
hard
to
figure
she
s
dead
let
s
talk
about
someone
alive
for
goodness
sake
montag
did
not
look
back
at
his
wife
as
he
went
trembling
along
the
hall
to
the
kitchen
where
he
stood
a
long
time
watching
the
rain
hit
the
windows
before
he
came
back
down
the
hall
in
the
gray
light
waiting
for
the
tremble
to
subside
he
opened
another
book
that
favorite
subject
myself
he
squinted
at
the
wall
that
favorite
subject
myself
i
understand
that
one
said
mildred
but
clarisse
s
favorite
subject
wasn
t
herself
it
was
everyone
else
and
me
she
was
the
first
person
in
a
good
many
years
i
ve
really
liked
she
was
the
first
person
i
can
remember
who
looked
straight
at
me
as
if
i
counted
he
lifted
the
two
books
these
men
have
been
dead
a
long
time
but
i
know
their
words
point
one
way
or
another
to
clarisse
outside
the
front
door
in
the
rain
a
faint
scratching
montag
froze
he
saw
mildred
thrust
herself
back
to
the
wall
and
gasp
someone
the
door
why
doesn
t
the
door
voice
tell
us
i
shut
it
off
under
the
doorsill
a
slow
probing
sniff
an
exhalation
of
electric
steam
mildred
laughed
it
s
only
a
dog
that
s
what
you
want
me
to
shoo
him
away
stay
where
you
are
silence
the
cold
rain
falling
and
the
smell
of
blue
electricity
blowing
under
the
locked
door
let
s
get
back
to
work
said
montag
quietly
mildred
kicked
at
a
book
books
aren
t
people
you
read
and
i
look
all
around
but
there
isn
t
anybody
he
stared
at
the
parlor
that
was
dead
and
gray
as
the
waters
of
an
ocean
that
might
teem
with
life
if
they
switched
on
the
electronic
sun
now
said
mildred
my
family
is
people
they
tell
me
"things;"
i
laugh
they
laugh
and
the
colors
yes
i
know
and
besides
if
captain
beatty
knew
about
those
books
she
thought
about
it
her
face
grew
amazed
and
then
horrified
he
might
come
and
burn
the
house
and
the
family
that
s
awful
think
of
our
investment
why
should
i
read
what
for
what
for
why
said
montag
i
saw
the
damnedest
snake
in
the
world
the
other
night
it
was
dead
but
it
was
alive
it
could
see
but
it
couldn
t
see
you
want
to
see
that
snake
it
s
at
emergency
hospital
where
they
filed
a
report
on
all
the
junk
the
snake
got
out
of
you
would
you
like
to
go
and
check
their
file
maybe
you
d
look
under
guy
montag
or
maybe
under
fear
or
war
would
you
like
to
go
to
that
house
that
burnt
last
night
and
rake
ashes
for
the
bones
of
the
woman
who
set
fire
to
her
own
house
what
about
clarisse
mcclellan
where
do
we
look
for
her
the
morgue
listen
the
bombers
crossed
the
sky
and
crossed
the
sky
over
the
house
gasping
murmuring
whistling
like
an
immense
invisible
fan
circling
in
emptiness
jesus
god
said
montag
every
hour
so
many
damn
things
in
the
sky
how
in
hell
did
those
bombers
get
up
there
every
single
second
of
our
lives
why
doesn
t
someone
want
to
talk
about
it
we
ve
started
and
won
two
atomic
wars
since
2022
is
it
because
we
re
having
so
much
fun
at
home
we
ve
forgotten
the
world
is
it
because
we
re
so
rich
and
the
rest
of
the
world
s
so
poor
and
we
just
don
t
care
if
they
are
i
ve
heard
"rumors;"
the
world
is
starving
but
we
re
well
fed
is
it
true
the
world
works
hard
and
we
play
is
that
why
we
re
hated
so
much
i
ve
heard
the
rumors
about
hate
too
once
in
a
long
while
over
the
years
do
you
know
why
i
don
t
that
s
sure
maybe
the
books
can
get
us
half
out
of
the
cave
they
just
might
stop
us
from
making
the
same
damn
insane
mistakes
i
don
t
hear
those
idiot
bastards
in
your
parlor
talking
about
it
god
millie
don
t
you
see
an
hour
a
day
two
hours
with
these
books
and
maybe
the
telephone
rang
mildred
snatched
the
phone
ann
she
laughed
yes
the
white
clown
s
on
tonight
montag
walked
to
the
kitchen
and
threw
the
book
down
montag
he
said
you
re
really
stupid
where
do
we
go
from
here
do
we
turn
the
books
in
forget
it
he
opened
the
book
to
read
over
mildred
s
laughter
poor
millie
he
thought
poor
montag
it
s
mud
to
you
too
but
where
do
you
get
help
where
do
you
find
a
teacher
this
late
hold
on
he
shut
his
eyes
yes
of
course
again
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
green
park
a
year
ago
the
thought
had
been
with
him
many
times
recently
but
now
he
remembered
how
it
was
that
day
in
the
city
park
when
he
had
seen
that
old
man
in
the
black
suit
hide
something
quickly
in
his
coat
the
old
man
leapt
up
as
if
to
run
and
montag
said
wait
i
haven
t
done
anything
cried
the
old
man
trembling
no
one
said
you
did
they
had
sat
in
the
green
soft
light
without
saying
a
word
for
a
moment
and
then
montag
talked
about
the
weather
and
then
the
old
man
responded
with
a
pale
voice
it
was
a
strange
quiet
meeting
the
old
man
admitted
to
being
a
retired
english
professor
who
had
been
thrown
out
upon
the
world
forty
years
ago
when
the
last
liberal
arts
college
shut
for
lack
of
students
and
patronage
his
name
was
faber
and
when
he
finally
lost
his
fear
of
montag
he
talked
in
a
cadenced
voice
looking
at
the
sky
and
the
trees
and
the
green
park
and
when
an
hour
had
passed
he
said
something
to
montag
and
montag
sensed
it
was
a
rhymeless
poem
then
the
old
man
grew
even
more
courageous
and
said
something
else
and
that
was
a
poem
too
faber
held
his
hand
over
his
left
coat
pocket
and
spoke
these
words
gently
and
montag
knew
if
he
reached
out
he
might
pull
a
book
of
poetry
from
the
man
s
coat
but
he
did
not
reach
out
his
hands
stayed
on
his
knees
numbed
and
useless
i
don
t
talk
things
sir
said
faber
i
talk
the
meaning
of
things
i
sit
here
and
know
i
m
alive
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
really
an
hour
of
monologue
a
poem
a
comment
and
then
without
either
acknowledging
the
fact
that
montag
was
a
fireman
faber
with
a
certain
trembling
wrote
his
address
on
a
slip
of
paper
for
your
file
he
said
in
case
you
decide
to
be
angry
with
me
i
m
not
angry
montag
said
surprised
mildred
shrieked
with
laughter
in
the
hall
montag
went
to
his
bedroom
closet
and
flipped
through
his
file
wallet
to
the
heading:
future
investigations
faber
s
name
was
there
he
hadn
t
turned
it
in
and
he
hadn
t
erased
it
he
dialed
the
call
on
a
secondary
phone
the
phone
on
the
far
end
of
the
line
called
faber
s
name
a
dozen
times
before
the
professor
answered
in
a
faint
voice
montag
identified
himself
and
was
met
with
a
lengthy
silence
yes
mr
montag
professor
faber
i
have
a
rather
odd
question
to
ask
how
many
copies
of
the
bible
are
left
in
this
country
i
don
t
know
what
you
re
talking
about
i
want
to
know
if
there
are
any
copies
left
at
all
this
is
some
sort
of
trap
i
can
t
talk
to
just
anyone
on
the
phone
how
many
copies
of
shakespeare
and
plato
none
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
none
faber
hung
up
montag
put
down
the
phone
none
a
thing
he
knew
of
course
from
the
firehouse
listings
but
somehow
he
had
wanted
to
hear
it
from
faber
himself
in
the
hall
mildred
s
face
was
suffused
with
excitement
well
the
ladies
are
coming
over
montag
showed
her
a
book
this
is
the
old
and
new
testament
and
don
t
start
that
again
it
might
be
the
last
copy
in
this
part
of
the
world
you
ve
got
to
hand
it
back
tonight
don
t
you
captain
beatty
knows
you
got
it
doesn
t
he
i
don
t
think
he
knows
which
book
i
stole
but
how
do
i
choose
a
substitute
do
i
turn
in
mr
jefferson
mr
thoreau
which
is
least
valuable
if
i
pick
a
substitute
and
beatty
does
know
which
book
i
stole
he
ll
guess
we
ve
an
entire
library
here
mildred
s
mouth
twitched
see
what
you
re
doing
you
ll
ruin
us
who
s
more
important
me
or
that
bible
she
was
beginning
to
shriek
now
sitting
there
like
a
wax
doll
melting
in
its
own
heat
he
could
hear
beatty
s
voice
sit
down
montag
watch
delicately
like
the
petals
of
a
flower
light
the
first
page
light
the
second
page
each
becomes
a
black
butterfly
beautiful
eh
light
the
third
page
from
the
second
and
so
on
chain
smoking
chapter
by
chapter
all
the
silly
things
the
words
mean
all
the
false
promises
all
the
secondhand
notions
and
time
worn
philosophies
there
sat
beatty
perspiring
gently
the
floor
littered
with
swarms
of
black
moths
that
had
died
in
a
single
storm
mildred
stopped
screaming
as
quickly
as
she
started
montag
was
not
listening
there
s
only
one
thing
to
do
he
said
some
time
before
tonight
when
i
give
the
book
to
beatty
i
ve
got
to
have
a
duplicate
made
you
ll
be
here
for
the
white
clown
tonight
and
the
ladies
coming
over
cried
mildred
montag
stopped
at
the
door
with
his
back
turned
millie
a
silence
what
millie
does
the
white
clown
love
you
no
answer
millie
does
he
licked
his
lips
does
your
family
love
you
love
you
very
much
love
you
with
all
their
heart
and
soul
millie
he
felt
her
blinking
slowly
at
the
back
of
his
neck
why
d
you
ask
a
silly
question
like
that
he
felt
he
wanted
to
cry
but
nothing
would
happen
to
his
eyes
or
his
mouth
if
you
see
that
dog
outside
said
mildred
give
him
a
kick
for
me
he
hesitated
listening
at
the
door
he
opened
it
and
stepped
out
the
rain
had
stopped
and
the
sun
was
setting
in
the
clear
sky
the
street
and
the
lawn
and
the
porch
were
empty
he
let
his
breath
go
in
a
great
sigh
he
slammed
the
door
he
was
on
the
subway
i
m
numb
he
thought
when
did
the
numbness
really
begin
in
my
face
in
my
body
the
night
i
kicked
the
pill
bottle
in
the
dark
like
kicking
a
buried
mine
the
numbness
will
go
away
he
thought
it
ll
take
time
but
i
ll
do
it
or
faber
will
do
it
for
me
someone
somewhere
will
give
me
back
the
old
face
and
the
old
hands
the
way
they
were
even
the
smile
he
thought
the
old
burnt
in
smile
that
s
gone
i
m
lost
without
it
the
subway
fled
past
him
cream
tile
jet
black
cream
tile
jet
black
numerals
and
darkness
more
darkness
and
the
total
adding
itself
once
as
a
child
he
had
sat
upon
a
yellow
dune
by
the
sea
in
the
middle
of
the
blue
and
hot
summer
day
trying
to
fill
a
sieve
with
sand
because
some
cruel
cousin
had
said
fill
this
sieve
and
you
ll
get
a
dime
and
the
faster
he
poured
the
faster
it
sifted
through
with
a
hot
whispering
his
hands
were
tired
the
sand
was
boiling
the
sieve
was
empty
seated
there
in
the
midst
of
july
without
a
sound
he
felt
the
tears
move
down
his
cheeks
now
as
the
vacuum
underground
rushed
him
through
the
dead
cellars
of
town
jolting
him
he
remembered
the
terrible
logic
of
that
sieve
and
he
looked
down
and
saw
that
he
was
carrying
the
bible
open
there
were
people
in
the
suction
train
but
he
held
the
book
in
his
hands
and
the
silly
thought
came
to
him
if
you
read
fast
and
read
all
maybe
some
of
the
sand
will
stay
in
the
sieve
but
he
read
and
the
worlds
fell
through
and
he
thought
in
a
few
hours
there
will
be
beatty
and
here
will
be
me
handing
this
over
so
no
phrase
must
escape
me
each
line
must
be
memorized
i
will
myself
to
do
it
he
clenched
the
book
in
his
fists
trumpets

he
tore
the
book
open
and
flicked
the
pages
and
felt
of
them
as
if
he
were
blind
he
picked
at
the
shape
of
the
individual
letters
not
blinking
denham

spelled:

shut

it
was
a
plea
a
cry
so
terrible
that
montag
found
himself
on
his
feet
the
shocked
inhabitants
of
the
loud
car
staring
moving
back
from
this
man
with
the
insane
gorged
face
the
gibbering
dry
mouth
the
flapping
book
in
his
fist
the
people
who
had
been
sitting
a
moment
before
tapping
their

pounded
into
"submission;"
they
did

there
was

stood

started
shut
only
then
did
he
leap
past
the
other
passengers
screaming
in
his
mind
plunge
through
the
slicing
door
only
in
time
he
ran
on
the
white
tiles
up
through
the
tunnels
ignoring
the
escalators
because
he
wanted
to
feel
his
feet
move

clench

out
here

in

dammit
you

i

the
front
door
opened
slowly
faber
peered
out
looking
very
old
in
the
light
and
very
fragile
and
very
much
afraid
the
old
man
looked
as
if
he
had
not
been
out
of
the
house
in
years
he
and
the
white
plaster
walls
inside
were
much
the
same
there
was
white
in
the
flesh
of
his
mouth
and
his
cheeks
and
his
hair
was
white
and
his
eyes
had
faded
with
white
in
the
vague
blueness
there
then
his
eyes
touched
on
the
book
under
montag
s
arm
and
he
did
not
look
so
old
any
more
and
not
quite
as
fragile
slowly
his
fear
went
i
m
sorry
one
has
to
be
careful
he
looked
at
the
book
under
montag
s
arm
and
could
not
stop
so
it
s
true
montag
stepped
inside
the
door
shut
sit
down
faber
backed
up
as
if
he
feared
the
book
might
vanish
if
he
took
his
eyes
from
it
behind
him
the
door
to
a
bedroom
stood
open
and
in
that
room
a
litter
of
machinery
and
steel
tools
were
strewn
upon
a
desktop
montag
had
only
a
glimpse
before
faber
seeing
montag
s
attention
diverted
turned
quickly
and
shut
the
bedroom
door
and
stood
holding
the
knob
with
a
trembling
hand
his
gaze
returned
unsteadily
to
montag
who
was
now
seated
with
the
book
in
his
lap
the
book
where
did
you
i
stole
it
faber
for
the
first
time
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
directly
into
montag
s
face
you
re
brave
no
said
montag
my
wife
s
dying
a
friend
of
mine
s
already
dead
someone
who
may
have
been
a
friend
was
burnt
less
than
twenty
four
hours
ago
you
re
the
only
one
i
knew
might
help
me
to
see
to
see
faber
s
hands
itched
on
his
knees
may
i
sorry
montag
gave
him
the
book
it
s
been
a
long
time
i
m
not
a
religious
man
but
it
s
been
a
long
time
faber
turned
the
pages
stopping
here
and
there
to
read
it
s
as
good
as
i
remember
lord
how
they
ve
changed
it
in
our
parlors
these
days
christ
is
one
of
the
family
now
i
often
wonder
if
god
recognizes
his
own
son
the
way
we
ve
dressed
him
up
or
is
it
dressed
him
down
he
s
a
regular
peppermint
stick
now
all
sugar
crystal
and
saccharine
when
he
isn
t
making
veiled
references
to
certain
commercial
products
that
every
worshiper
absolutely
needs
faber
sniffed
the
book
do
you
know
that
books
smell
like
nutmeg
or
some
spice
from
a
foreign
land
i
loved
to
smell
them
when
i
was
a
boy
lord
there
were
a
lot
of
lovely
books
once
before
we
let
them
go
faber
turned
the
pages
mr
montag
you
are
looking
at
a
coward
i
saw
the
way
things
were
going
a
long
time
back
i
said
nothing
i
m
one
of
the
innocents
who
could
have
spoken
up
and
out
when
no
one
would
listen
to
the
guilty
but
i
did
not
speak
and
thus
became
guilty
myself
and
when
finally
they
set
the
structure
to
burn
the
books
using
the
firemen
i
grunted
a
few
times
and
subsided
for
there
were
no
others
grunting
or
yelling
with
me
by
then
now
it
s
too
late
faber
closed
the
bible
well
suppose
you
tell
me
why
you
came
here
nobody
listens
any
more
i
can
t
talk
to
the
walls
because
they
re
yelling
at
me
i
can
t
talk
to
my
"wife;"
she
listens
to
the
walls
i
just
want
someone
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
and
maybe
if
i
talk
long
enough
it
ll
make
sense
and
i
want
you
to
teach
me
to
understand
what
i
read
faber
examined
montag
s
thin
blue
jowled
face
how
did
you
get
shaken
up
what
knocked
the
torch
out
of
your
hands
i
don
t
know
we
have
everything
we
need
to
be
happy
but
we
aren
t
happy
something
s
missing
i
looked
around
the
only
thing
i
positively
knew
was
gone
was
the
books
i
d
burned
in
ten
or
twelve
years
so
i
thought
books
might
help
you
re
a
hopeless
romantic
said
faber
it
would
be
funny
if
it
were
not
serious
it
s
not
books
you
need
it
s
some
of
the
things
that
once
were
in
books
the
same
things
could
be
in
the
parlor
families
today
the
same
infinite
detail
and
awareness
could
be
projected
through
the
radios
and
televisors
but
are
not
no
no
it
s
not
books
at
all
you
re
looking
for
take
it
where
you
can
find
it
in
old
phonograph
records
old
motion
pictures
and
in
old
"friends;"
look
for
it
in
nature
and
look
for
it
in
yourself
books
were
only
one
type
of
receptacle
where
we
stored
a
lot
of
things
we
were
afraid
we
might
forget
there
is
nothing
magical
in
them
at
all
the
magic
is
only
in
what
books
say
how
they
stitched
the
patches
of
the
universe
together
into
one
garment
for
us
of
course
you
couldn
t
know
this
of
course
you
still
can
t
understand
what
i
mean
when
i
say
all
this
you
are
intuitively
right
that
s
what
counts
three
things
are
missing
number
one:
do
you
know
why
books
such
as
this
are
so
important
because
they
have
quality
and
what
does
the
word
quality
mean
to
me
it
means
texture
this
book
has
pores
it
has
features
this
book
can
go
under
the
microscope
you
d
find
life
under
the
glass
streaming
past
in
infinite
profusion
the
more
pores
the
more
truthfully
recorded
details
of
life
per
square
inch
you
can
get
on
a
sheet
of
paper
the
more
literary
you
are
that
s
my
definition
anyway
telling
detail
fresh
detail
the
good
writers
touch
life
often
the
mediocre
ones
run
a
quick
hand
over
her
the
bad
ones
rape
her
and
leave
her
for
the
flies
so
now
do
you
see
why
books
are
hated
and
feared
they
show
the
pores
in
the
face
of
life
the
comfortable
people
want
only
wax
moon
faces
poreless
hairless
expressionless
we
are
living
in
a
time
when
flowers
are
trying
to
live
on
flowers
instead
of
growing
on
good
rain
and
black
loam
even
fireworks
for
all
their
prettiness
come
from
the
chemistry
of
the
earth
yet
somehow
we
think
we
can
grow
feeding
on
flowers
and
fireworks
without
completing
the
cycle
back
to
reality
do
you
know
the
legend
of
hercules
and
antaeus
the
giant
wrestler
whose
strength
was
incredible
so
long
as
he
stood
firmly
on
the
earth
but
when
he
was
held
rootless
in
midair
by
hercules
he
perished
easily
if
there
isn
t
something
in
that
legend
for
us
today
in
this
city
in
our
time
then
i
am
completely
insane
well
there
we
have
the
first
thing
i
said
we
needed
quality
texture
of
information
and
the
second
leisure
oh
but
we
ve
plenty
of
off
hours
off
hours
yes
but
time
to
think
if
you
re
not
driving
a
hundred
miles
an
hour
at
a
clip
where
you
can
t
think
of
anything
else
but
the
danger
then
you
re
playing
some
game
or
sitting
in
some
room
where
you
can
t
argue
with
the
four
wall
televisor
why
the
televisor
is
real
it
is
immediate
it
has
dimension
it
tells
you
what
to
think
and
blasts
it
in
it
must
be
right
it
seems
so
right
it
rushes
you
on
so
quickly
to
its
own
conclusions
your
mind
hasn
t
time
to
protest
what
nonsense
only
the
family
is
people
i
beg
pardon
my
wife
says
books
aren
t
real
thank
god
for
that
you
can
shut
them
say
hold
on
a
moment
you
play
god
to
it
but
who
has
ever
torn
himself
from
the
claw
that
encloses
you
when
you
drop
a
seed
in
a
tv
parlor
it
grows
you
any
shape
it
wishes
it
is
an
environment
as
real
as
the
world
it
becomes
and
is
the
truth
books
can
be
beaten
down
with
reason
but
with
all
my
knowledge
and
skepticism
i
have
never
been
able
to
argue
with
a
one
hundred
piece
symphony
orchestra
full
color
three
dimensions
and
being
in
and
part
of
those
incredible
parlors
as
you
see
my
parlor
is
nothing
but
four
plaster
walls
and
here
he
held
out
two
small
rubber
plugs
for
my
ears
when
i
ride
the
subway
jets
denham
s
"dentifrice;"
they
toil
not
neither
do
they
spin
said
montag
eyes
shut
where
do
we
go
from
here
would
books
help
us
only
if
the
third
necessary
thing
could
be
given
us
number
one
as
i
said
quality
of
information
number
two:
leisure
to
digest
it
and
number
three:
the
right
to
carry
out
actions
based
on
what
we
learn
from
the
interaction
of
the
first
two
and
i
hardly
think
a
very
old
man
and
a
fireman
turned
sour
could
do
much
this
late
in
the
game
i
can
get
books
you
re
running
a
risk
that
s
the
good
part
of
"dying;"
when
you
ve
nothing
to
lose
you
run
any
risk
you
want
there
you
ve
said
an
interesting
thing
laughed
faber
without
having
read
it
are
things
like
that
in
books
but
it
came
off
the
top
of
my
mind
all
the
better
you
didn
t
fancy
it
up
for
me
or
anyone
even
yourself
montag
leaned
forward
this
afternoon
i
thought
that
if
it
turned
out
that
books
were
worthwhile
we
might
get
a
press
and
print
some
extra
copies
we
you
and
i
oh
no
faber
sat
up
but
let
me
tell
you
my
plan
if
you
insist
on
telling
me
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
but
aren
t
you
interested
not
if
you
start
talking
the
sort
of
talk
that
might
get
me
burnt
for
my
trouble
the
only
way
i
could
possibly
listen
to
you
would
be
if
somehow
the
fireman
structure
itself
could
be
burnt
now
if
you
suggest
that
we
print
extra
books
and
arrange
to
have
them
hidden
in
firemen
s
houses
all
over
the
country
so
that
seeds
of
suspicion
would
be
sown
among
these
arsonists
bravo
i
d
say
plant
the
books
turn
in
an
alarm
and
see
the
firemen
s
houses
burn
is
that
what
you
mean
faber
raised
his
brows
and
looked
at
montag
as
if
he
were
seeing
a
new
man
i
was
joking
if
you
thought
it
would
be
a
plan
worth
trying
i
d
have
to
take
your
word
it
would
help
you
can
t
guarantee
things
like
that
after
all
when
we
had
all
the
books
we
needed
we
still
insisted
on
finding
the
highest
cliff
to
jump
off
but
we
do
need
a
breather
we
do
need
knowledge
and
perhaps
in
a
thousand
years
we
might
pick
smaller
cliffs
to
jump
off
the
books
are
to
remind
us
what
asses
and
fools
we
are
they
re
caesar
s
praetorian
guard
whispering
as
the
parade
roars
down
the
avenue
remember
caesar
thou
art
mortal
most
of
us
can
t
rush
around
talk
to
everyone
know
all
the
cities
of
the
world
we
haven
t
time
money
or
that
many
friends
the
things
you
re
looking
for
montag
are
in
the
world
but
the
only
way
the
average
chap
will
ever
see
ninety
nine
percent
of
them
is
in
a
book
don
t
ask
for
guarantees
and
don
t
look
to
be
saved
in
any
one
thing
person
machine
or
library
do
your
own
bit
of
saving
and
if
you
drown
at
least
die
knowing
you
were
headed
for
shore
faber
got
up
and
began
to
pace
the
room
well
asked
montag
you
re
absolutely
serious
absolutely
it
s
an
insidious
plan
if
i
do
say
so
myself
faber
glanced
nervously
at
his
bedroom
door
to
see
the
firehouses
burn
across
the
land
destroyed
as
hotbeds
of
treason
the
salamander
devours
his
tail
ho
god
i
ve
a
list
of
firemen
s
residences
everywhere
with
some
sort
of
underground
can
t
trust
people
that
s
the
dirty
part
you
and
i
and
who
else
will
set
the
fires
aren
t
there
professors
like
yourself
former
writers
historians
linguists
dead
or
ancient
the
older
the
"better;"
they
ll
go
unnoticed
you
know
dozens
admit
it
oh
there
are
many
actors
alone
who
haven
t
acted
pirandello
or
shaw
or
shakespeare
for
years
because
their
plays
are
too
aware
of
the
world
we
could
use
their
anger
and
we
could
use
the
honest
rage
of
those
historians
who
haven
t
written
a
line
for
forty
years
true
we
might
form
classes
in
thinking
and
reading
yes
but
that
would
just
nibble
the
edges
the
whole
culture
s
shot
through
the
skeleton
needs
melting
and
reshaping
good
god
it
isn
t
as
simple
as
just
picking
up
a
book
you
laid
down
half
a
century
ago
remember
the
firemen
are
rarely
necessary
the
public
itself
stopped
reading
of
its
own
accord
you
firemen
provide
a
circus
now
and
then
at
which
buildings
are
set
off
and
crowds
gather
for
the
pretty
blaze
but
it
s
a
small
sideshow
indeed
and
hardly
necessary
to
keep
things
in
line
so
few
want
to
be
rebels
anymore
and
out
of
those
few
most
like
myself
scare
easily
can
you
dance
faster
than
the
white
clown
shout
louder
than
mr
gimmick
and
the
parlor
families
if
you
can
you
ll
win
your
way
montag
in
any
event
you
re
a
fool
people
are
having
fun
committing
suicide
murdering
a
bomber
fight
had
been
moving
east
all
the
time
they
talked
and
only
now
did
the
two
men
stop
and
listen
feeling
the
great
jet
sound
tremble
inside
themselves
patience
montag
let
the
war
turn
off
the
families
our
civilization
is
flinging
itself
to
pieces
stand
back
from
the
centrifuge
there
has
to
be
someone
ready
when
it
blows
up
what
men
quoting
milton
saying
i
remember
sophocles
reminding
the
survivors
that
man
has
his
good
side
too
they
will
only
gather
up
their
stones
to
hurl
at
each
other
montag
go
home
go
to
bed
why
waste
your
final
hours
racing
about
your
cage
denying
you
re
a
squirrel
then
you
don
t
care
any
more
i
care
so
much
i
m
sick
and
you
won
t
help
me
good
night
good
night
montag
s
hands
picked
up
the
bible
he
saw
what
his
hands
had
done
and
he
looked
surprised
would
you
like
to
own
this
faber
said
i
d
give
my
right
arm
montag
stood
there
and
waited
for
the
next
thing
to
happen
his
hands
by
themselves
like
two
men
working
together
began
to
rip
the
pages
from
the
book
the
hands
tore
the
flyleaf
and
then
the
first
and
then
the
second
page
idiot
what
re
you
doing
faber
sprang
up
as
if
he
had
been
struck
he
fell
against
montag
montag
warded
him
off
and
let
his
hands
continue
six
more
pages
fell
to
the
floor
he
picked
them
up
and
wadded
the
paper
under
faber
s
gaze
don
t
oh
don
t
said
the
old
man
who
can
stop
me
i
m
a
fireman
i
can
burn
you
the
old
man
stood
looking
at
him
you
wouldn
t
i
could
the
book
don
t
tear
it
any
more
faber
sank
into
a
chair
his
face
very
white
his
mouth
trembling
don
t
make
me
feel
any
more
tired
what
do
you
want
i
need
you
to
teach
me
all
right
all
right
montag
put
the
book
down
he
began
to
unwad
the
crumpled
paper
and
flatten
it
out
as
the
old
man
watched
tiredly
faber
shook
his
head
as
if
he
were
waking
up
montag
have
you
any
money
some
four
five
hundred
dollars
why
bring
it
i
know
a
man
who
printed
our
college
paper
half
a
century
ago
that
was
the
year
i
came
to
class
at
the
start
of
the
new
semester
and
found
only
one
student
to
sign
up
for
drama
from
aeschylus
to
o
neill
you
see
how
like
a
beautiful
statue
of
ice
it
was
melting
in
the
sun
i
remember
the
newspapers
dying
like
huge
moths
no
one
wanted
them
back
no
one
missed
them
and
then
the
government
seeing
how
advantageous
it
was
to
have
people
reading
only
about
passionate
lips
and
the
fist
in
the
stomach
circled
the
situation
with
your
fire
eaters
so
montag
there
s
this
unemployed
printer
we
might
start
a
few
books
and
wait
on
the
war
to
break
the
pattern
and
give
us
the
push
we
need
a
few
bombs
and
the
families
in
the
walls
of
all
the
houses
like
harlequin
rats
will
shut
up
in
the
silence
our
stage
whisper
might
carry
they
both
stood
looking
at
the
book
on
the
table
i
ve
tried
to
remember
said
montag
but
hell
it
s
gone
when
i
turn
my
head
god
how
i
want
something
to
say
to
the
captain
he
s
read
enough
so
he
has
all
the
answers
or
seems
to
have
his
voice
is
like
butter
i
m
afraid
he
ll
talk
me
back
the
way
i
was
only
a
week
ago
pumping
a
kerosene
hose
i
thought:
god
what
fun
the
old
man
nodded
those
who
don
t
build
must
burn
it
s
as
old
as
history
and
juvenile
delinquents
so
that
s
what
i
am
there
s
some
of
it
in
all
of
us
montag
moved
toward
the
front
door
can
you
help
me
in
any
way
tonight
with
the
fire
captain
i
need
an
umbrella
to
keep
off
the
rain
i
m
so
damned
afraid
i
ll
drown
if
he
gets
me
again
the
old
man
said
nothing
but
glanced
once
more
nervously
at
his
bedroom
montag
caught
the
glance
well
the
old
man
took
a
deep
breath
held
it
and
let
it
out
he
took
another
eyes
closed
his
mouth
tight
and
at
last
exhaled
montag
the
old
man
turned
at
last
and
said
come
along
i
would
actually
have
let
you
walk
right
out
of
my
house
i
am
a
cowardly
old
fool
faber
opened
the
bedroom
door
and
led
montag
into
a
small
chamber
where
stood
a
table
upon
which
a
number
of
metal
tools
lay
among
a
welter
of
microscopic
wire
hairs
tiny
coils
bobbins
and
crystals
what
s
this
asked
montag
proof
of
my
terrible
cowardice
i
ve
lived
alone
so
many
years
throwing
images
on
walls
with
my
imagination
fiddling
with
electronics
radio
transmission
has
been
my
hobby
my
cowardice
is
of
such
a
passion
complementing
the
revolutionary
spirit
that
lives
in
its
shadow
i
was
forced
to
design
this
he
picked
up
a
small
green
metal
object
no
larger
than
a
22
bullet
i
paid
for
all
this
how
playing
the
stock
market
of
course
the
last
refuge
in
the
world
for
the
dangerous
intellectual
out
of
a
job
well
i
played
the
market
and
built
all
this
and
i
ve
waited
i
ve
waited
trembling
half
a
lifetime
for
someone
to
speak
to
me
i
dared
speak
to
no
one
that
day
in
the
park
when
we
sat
together
i
knew
that
some
day
you
might
drop
by
with
fire
or
friendship
it
was
hard
to
guess
i
ve
had
this
little
item
ready
for
months
but
i
almost
let
you
go
i
m
that
afraid
it
looks
like
a
seashell
radio
and
something
more
it
lis
tens
if
you
put
it
in
your
ear
montag
i
can
sit
comfortably
home
warming
my
frightened
bones
and
hear
and
analyze
the
firemen
s
world
find
its
weaknesses
without
danger
i
m
the
queen
bee
safe
in
the
hive
you
will
be
the
drone
the
traveling
ear
eventually
i
could
put
out
ears
into
all
parts
of
the
city
with
various
men
listening
and
evaluating
if
the
drones
die
i
m
still
safe
at
home
tending
my
fright
with
a
maximum
of
comfort
and
a
minimum
of
chance
see
how
safe
i
play
it
how
contemptible
i
am
montag
placed
the
green
bullet
in
his
ear
the
old
man
inserted
a
similar
object
in
his
own
ear
and
moved
his
lips
montag
the
voice
was
in
montag
s
head
i
hear
you
the
old
man
laughed
you
re
coming
over
fine
too
faber
whispered
but
the
voice
in
montag
s
head
was
clear
go
to
the
firehouse
when
it
s
time
i
ll
be
with
you
let
s
listen
to
this
captain
beatty
together
he
could
be
one
of
us
god
knows
i
ll
give
you
things
to
say
we
ll
give
him
a
good
show
do
you
hate
me
for
this
electronic
cowardice
of
mine
here
i
am
sending
you
out
into
the
night
while
i
stay
behind
the
lines
with
my
damned
ears
listening
for
you
to
get
your
head
chopped
off
we
all
do
what
we
do
said
montag
he
put
the
bible
in
the
old
man
s
hands
here
i
ll
chance
turning
in
a
substitute
tomorrow
i
ll
see
the
unemployed
printer
"yes;"
that
much
i
can
do
good
night
professor
not
good
night
i
ll
be
with
you
the
rest
of
the
night
a
vinegar
gnat
tickling
your
ear
when
you
need
me
but
good
night
and
good
luck
anyway
the
door
opened
and
shut
montag
was
in
the
dark
street
again
looking
at
the
world
you
could
feel
the
war
getting
ready
in
the
sky
that
night
the
way
the
clouds
moved
aside
and
came
back
and
the
way
the
stars
looked
a
million
of
them
swimming
between
the
clouds
like
the
enemy
disks
and
the
feeling
that
the
sky
might
fall
upon
the
city
and
turn
it
to
chalk
dust
and
the
moon
go
up
in
red
"fire;"
that
was
how
the
night
felt
montag
walked
from
the
subway
with
the
money
in
his
pocket
he
had
visited
the
bank
which
was
open
all
night
every
night
with
robot
tellers
in
attendance
and
as
he
walked
he
was
listening
to
the
seashell
radio
in
one
ear
we
have
mobilized
a
million
men
quick
victory
is
ours
if
the
war
comes
music
flooded
over
the
voice
quickly
and
it
was
gone
ten
million
men
mobilized
faber
s
voice
whispered
in
his
other
ear
but
say
one
million
it
s
happier
faber
yes
i
m
not
thinking
i
m
just
doing
like
i
m
told
like
always
you
said
get
the
money
and
i
got
it
i
didn
t
really
think
of
it
myself
when
do
i
start
working
things
out
on
my
own
you
ve
started
already
by
saying
what
you
just
said
you
ll
have
to
take
me
on
faith
i
took
the
others
on
faith
yes
and
look
where
we
re
headed
you
ll
have
to
travel
blind
for
a
while
here
s
my
arm
to
hold
onto
i
don
t
want
to
change
sides
and
just
be
told
what
to
do
there
s
no
reason
to
change
if
i
do
that
you
re
wise
already
montag
felt
his
feet
moving
him
on
the
sidewalk
toward
his
house
keep
talking
would
you
like
me
to
read
i
ll
read
so
you
can
remember
i
go
to
bed
only
five
hours
a
night
nothing
to
do
so
if
you
like
i
ll
read
you
to
sleep
nights
they
say
you
retain
knowledge
even
when
you
re
sleeping
if
someone
whispers
it
in
your
ear
yes
here
far
away
across
town
in
the
night
the
faintest
whisper
of
a
turned
page
the
book
of
job
the
moon
rose
in
the
sky
as
montag
walked
his
lips
moving
just
a
trifle
he
was
eating
a
light
supper
at
nine
in
the
evening
when
the
front
door
cried
out
in
the
hall
and
mildred
ran
from
the
parlor
like
a
native
fleeing
an
eruption
of
vesuvius
mrs
phelps
and
mrs
bowles
came
through
the
front
door
and
vanished
into
the
volcano
s
mouth
with
martinis
in
their
hands
montag
stopped
eating
they
were
like
a
monstrous
crystal
chandelier
tinkling
in
a
thousand
chimes
he
saw
their
cheshire
cat
smiles
burning
through
the
walls
of
the
house
and
now
they
were
screaming
at
each
other
above
the
din
montag
found
himself
at
the
parlor
door
with
his
food
still
in
his
mouth
doesn
t
everyone
look
nice
nice
you
look
fine
millie
fine
everyone
looks
swell
swell
montag
stood
watching
them
patience
whispered
faber
i
shouldn
t
be
here
whispered
montag
almost
to
himself
i
should
be
on
my
way
back
to
you
with
the
money
tomorrow
s
time
enough
careful
isn
t
this
show
wonderful
cried
mildred
wonderful
on
one
wall
a
woman
smiled
and
drank
orange
juice
simultaneously
how
does
she
do
both
at
once
thought
montag
insanely
in
the
other
walls
an
x
ray
of
the
same
woman
revealed
the
contracting
journey
of
the
refreshing
beverage
on
its
way
to
her
delighted
stomach
abruptly
the
room
took
off
on
a
rocket
flight
into
the
"clouds;"
it
plunged
into
a
lime
green
sea
where
blue
fish
ate
red
and
yellow
fish
a
minute
later
three
white
cartoon
clowns
chopped
off
each
other
s
limbs
to
the
accompaniment
of
immense
incoming
tides
of
laughter
two
minutes
more
and
the
room
whipped
out
of
town
to
the
jet
cars
wildly
circling
an
arena
bashing
and
backing
up
and
bashing
each
other
again
montag
saw
a
number
of
bodies
fly
in
the
air
millie
did
you
see
that
i
saw
it
i
saw
it
montag
reached
inside
the
parlor
wall
and
pulled
the
main
switch
the
images
drained
away
as
if
the
water
had
been
let
from
a
gigantic
crystal
bowl
of
hysterical
fish
the
three
women
turned
slowly
and
looked
with
unconcealed
irritation
and
then
dislike
at
montag
when
do
you
suppose
the
war
will
start
he
said
i
notice
your
husbands
aren
t
here
tonight
oh
they
come
and
go
come
and
go
said
mrs
phelps
in
again
out
again
finnegan
the
army
called
pete

he
ll
be
back
next
week
the
army
said

said
and
everyone
home
that
s
what
the
army
said
quick
war
pete
was
called
yesterday
and
they
said
he
d
be
back
next
week
quick
the
three
women
fidgeted
and
looked
nervously
at
the
empty
mud
colored
walls
i
m
not
worried
said
mrs
phelps
i
ll
let
pete
do
all
the
worrying
she
giggled
i
ll
let
old
pete

all
the
worrying

a
war

off
buildings
yes
like
gloria
s
husband
last
week
but

said
mrs
phelps
anyway
pete

i
always
said
no
tears
nothing
like
that
it
s
our
third
marriage
each
and
we

he
said

just
go
right
ahead
and
don
t
cry
but
get
married
again
and
don
t
think
of
me
that
reminds
me
said
mildred
did
you
see
that
clara
dove
five
minute
romance
last
night
in
your
wall
well
it
was
all
about
this
woman
who
montag
said
nothing
but
stood
looking
at
the
women
s
faces
as
he
had
once
looked
at
the
face
of
saints
in
a
strange
church
he
had
entered
when
he
was
a
child
the
faces
of
those
enameled
creatures
meant
nothing
to
him
though
he
talked
to
them
and
stood
in
that
church
for
a
long
time
trying
to
be
of
that
religion
trying
to
know
what
that
religion
was
trying
to
get
enough
of
the
raw
incense
and
special
dust
of
the
place
into
his
lungs
and
thus
into
his
blood
to
feel
touched
and
concerned
by
the
meaning
of
the
colorful
men
and
women
with
the
porcelain
eyes
and
the
blood
ruby
lips
but
there
was
nothing
"nothing;"
it
was
a
stroll
through
another
store
and
his
currency
strange
and
unusable
there
and
his
passion
cold
even
when
he
touched
the
wood
and
plaster
and
clay
so
it
was
now
in
his
own
parlor
with
these
women
twisting
in
their
chairs
under
his
gaze
lighting
cigarettes
blowing
smoke
touching
their
sun
fired
hair
and
examining
their
blazing
fingernails
as
if
they
had
caught
fire
from
his
look
their
faces
grew
haunted
with
silence
they
leaned
forward
at
the
sound
of
montag
s
swallowing
his
fin
al
bite
of
food
they
listened
to
his
feverish
breathing
the
three
empty
walls
of
the
room
were
like
the
pale
brows
of
sleeping
giants
now
empty
of
dreams
montag
felt
that
if
you
touched
these
three
staring
brows
you
would
feel
a
fine
salt
sweat
on
your
fingertips
the
perspiration
gathered
with
the
silence
and
the
subaudible
trembling
around
and
about
and
in
the
women
who
were
burning
with
tension
any
moment
they
might
hiss
a
long
sputtering
hiss
and
explode
montag
moved
his
lips
let
s
talk
the
women
jerked
and
stared
how
re
your
children
mrs
phelps
he
asked
you
know
i
haven
t
any
no
one
in
his
right
mind
the
good
lord
knows
would
have
children
said
mrs
phelps
not
quite
sure
why
she
was
angry
with
this
man
i
wouldn
t
say
that
said
mrs
bowles
i
ve
had
two
children
by
caesarean
section
no
use
going
through
all
that
agony
for
a
baby
the
world
must
reproduce
you
know
the
race
must
go
on
besides
they
sometimes
look
just
like
you
and
that
s
nice
two
caesareans
turned
the
trick
yes
sir
oh
my
doctor
said
caesareans
aren
t
"necessary;"
you
ve
got
the
hips
for
it
everything
s
normal
but
i
insisted
caesareans
or
not
children
are
"ruinous;"
you
re
out
of
your
mind
said
mrs
phelps
i
plunk
the
children
in
school
nine
days
out
of
ten
i
put
up
with
them
when
they
come
home
three
days
a
"month;"
it
s
not
bad
at
all
you
heave
them
into
the
parlor
and
turn
the
switch
it
s
like
washing
"clothes;"
stuff
laundry
in
and
slam
the
lid
mrs
bowled
tittered
they
d
just
as
soon
kick
as
kiss
me
thank
god
i
can
kick
back
the
women
showed
their
tongues
laughing
mildred
sat
a
moment
and
then
seeing
that
montag
was
still
in
the
doorway
clapped
her
hands
let
s
talk
politics
to
please
guy
sounds
fine
said
mrs
bowles
i
voted
last
election
same
as
everyone
and
i
laid
it
on
the
line
for
president
noble
i
think
he
s
one
of
the
nicest
looking
men
ever
became
president
oh
but
the
man
they
ran
against
him
he
wasn
t
much
was
he
kind
of
small
and
homely
and
he
didn
t
shave
too
close
or
comb
his
hair
very
well
what
possessed
the
outs
to
run
him
you
just
don
t
go
running
a
little
short
man
like
that
against
a
tall

she
glanced
nervously
at
the
long
emptiness
of
the
walls
enclosing
them
montag

through
with
this
and
i

the
living
daylights
out
mildred
looked
at
the
empty
air
now
guy
just
who
are
you
talking
to
a
silver
needle
pierced
his
brain
montag
listen
only
one
way
out
play
it
as
a
joke
cover
up
pretend
you
aren
t
mad
at
all
then
walk
to
your
wall
incinerator
and
throw
the
book
in
mildred
had
already
anticipated
this
in
a
quavery
voice
ladies
once
a
year
every
fireman
s
allowed
to
bring
one
book
home
from
the
old
days
to
show
his
family
how
silly
it
all
was
how
nervous
that
sort
of
thing
can
make
you
how
crazy
guy
s
surprise
tonight
is
to
read
you
one
sample
to
show
how
mixed
up
things
were
so
none
of
us
will
ever
have
to
bother
our
little
old
heads
about
that
junk
again
isn
t
that
right
darling
he
crushed
the
book
in
his
fists
say
yes
his
mouth
moved
like
faber
s:
yes
mildred
snatched
the
book
with
a
laugh
here
read
this
one
no
i
take
it
back
here
s
that
real
funny
one
you
read
out
loud
today
ladies
you
won
t
understand
a
word
it
goes
umpty
tumpty
ump
go
ahead
guy
that
page
dear
he
looked
at
the
opened
page
a
fly
stirred
its
wings
softly
in
his
ear
read
what
s
the
title
dear
dover
beach
his
mouth
was
numb
now
read
in
a
nice
clear
voice
and
go
slow
the
room
was
blazing
hot
he
was
all
fire
he
was
all
"coldness;"
they
sat
in
the
middle
of
an
empty
desert
with
three
chairs
and
him
standing
swaying
and
him
waiting
for
mrs
phelps
to
stop
straightening
her
dress
hem
and
mrs
bowles
to
take
her
fingers
away
from
her
hair
then
he
began
to
read
in
a
low
stumbling
voice
that
grew
firmer
as
he
progressed
from
line
to
line
and
his
voice
went
out
across
the
desert
into
the
whiteness
and
around
the
three
sitting
women
there
in
the
great
hot
emptiness
the
sea
of
faith
was
once
too
at
the
full
and
round
earth
s
shore
lay
like
the
folds
of
a
bright
girdle
furled
but
now
i
only
hear
its
melancholy
long
withdrawing
roar
retreating
to
the
breath
of
the
night
wind
down
the
vast
edges
drear
and
naked
shingles
of
the
world
the
chairs
creaked
under
the
three
women
montag
finished
it
out:
ah
love
let
us
be
true
to
one
another
for
the
world
which
seems
to
lie
before
us
like
a
land
of
dreams
so
various
so
beautiful
so
new
hath
really
neither
joy
nor
love
nor
light
nor
certitude
nor
peace
nor
help
for
"pain;"
and
we
are
here
as
on
a
darkling
plain
swept
with
confused
alarms
of
struggle
and
flight
where
ignorant
armies
clash
by
night
mrs
phelps
was
crying
the
others
in
the
middle
of
the
desert
watched
her
crying
grow
very
loud
as
her
face
squeezed
itself
out
of
shape
they
sat
not
touching
her
bewildered
with
her
display
she
sobbed
uncontrollably
montag
himself
was
stunned
and
shaken
sh
sh
said
mildred

re
all
right

of
it
clara

mrs
phelps

and

mush
now
i

proved
to
me

nasty
mr
montag

faber
said
now
montag
felt
himself
turn
and
walk
to
the
wall
slot
and
drop
the
book
in
through
the
brass
notch
to
the
waiting
flames
silly
words
silly
words
silly
awful
hurting
words
said
mrs
bowles
why

people
want
to
hurt

not
enough

the
world

to
tease
people
with

arm

mrs
bowles
i
m
trotting
right
straight
home
you
want
to
visit
my
house
and
my
family
well
and
good
but
i
won
t
come
in
this
fireman
s
crazy
house
again
in
my
lifetime
go
home
montag
fixed
his
eyes
upon
her
quietly
go
home
and
think
of
your
first
husband
divorced
and
your
second
husband
killed
in
a
jet
and
your
third
husband
blowing
his
brains
out
go
home
and
think
of
the
dozen
abortions
you
ve
had
go
home
and
think
of
that
and
your
damn
caesarean
sections
too
and
your
children
who
hate
your
guts
go
home
and
think
how
it
all
happened
and
what
did
you
ever
do
to
stop
it
go
home
go
home
he
yelled
before
i
knock
you
down
and
kick
you
out
the
door
doors
slammed
and
the
house
was
empty
montag
stood
alone
in
the
winter
weather
with
the
parlor
walls
the
color
of
dirty
snow
in
the
bathroom
water
ran
he
heard
mildred
shake
the
sleeping
tablets
into
her
hand
fool
montag
fool
fool
oh
god
you
silly
fool
shut
up
he
pulled
the
green
bullet
from
his
ear
and
jammed
it
into
his
pocket
it
sizzled
faintly
fool
fool
he
searched
the
house
and
found
the
books
where
mildred
had
stacked
them
behind
the
refrigerator
some
were
missing
and
he
knew
that
she
had
started
on
her
own
slow
process
of
dispersing
the
dynamite
in
her
house
stick
by
stick
but
he
was
not
angry
now
only
exhausted
and
bewildered
with
himself
he
carried
the
books
into
the
backyard
and
hid
them
in
the
bushes
near
the
alley
fence
for
tonight
only
he
thought
in
case
she
decides
to
do
any
more
burning
he
went
back
through
the
house
mildred
he
called
at
the
door
of
the
darkened
bedroom
there
was
no
sound
outside
crossing
t
he
lawn
on
his
way
to
work
he
tried
not
to
see
how
completely
dark
and
deserted
clarisse
mcclellan
s
house
was
on
the
way
downtown
he
was
so
completely
alone
with
his
terrible
error
that
he
felt
the
necessity
for
the
strange
warmness
and
goodness
that
came
from
a
familiar
and
gentle
voice
speaking
in
the
night
already
in
a
few
short
hours
it
seemed
that
he
had
known
faber
for
a
lifetime
now
he
knew
that
he
was
two
people
that
he
was
above
all
montag
who
knew
nothing
who
did
not
even
know
himself
a
fool
but
only
suspected
it
and
he
knew
that
he
was
also
the
old
man
who
talked
to
him
and
talked
to
him
as
the
train
was
sucked
from
one
end
of
the
night
city
to
the
other
on
one
long
sickening
gasp
of
motion
in
the
days
to
follow
and
in
the
nights
when
there
was
no
moon
and
in
the
nights
when
there
was
a
very
bright
moon
shining
on
the
earth
the
old
man
would
go
on
with
this
talking
and
this
talking
drop
by
drop
stone
by
stone
flake
by
flake
his
mind
would
well
over
at
last
and
he
would
not
be
montag
any
more
this
the
old
man
told
him
assured
him
promised
him
he
would
be
montag
plus
faber
fire
plus
water
and
then
one
day
after
everything
had
mixed
and
simmered
and
worked
away
in
silence
there
would
be
neither
fire
nor
water
but
wine
out
of
two
separate
and
opposite
things
a
third
and
one
day
he
would
look
back
upon
the
fool
and
know
the
fool
even
now
he
could
feel
the
start
of
the
long
journey
the
leave
taking
the
going
away
from
the
self
he
had
been
it
was
good
listening
to
the
beetle
hum
the
sleepy
mosquito
buzz
and
delicate
filigree
murmur
of
the
old
man
s
voice
at
first
scolding
him
and
then
consoling
him
in
the
late
hour
of
night
as
he
emerged
from
the
steaming
subway
toward
the
firehouse
world
pity
montag
pity
don
t
haggle
and
nag
"them;"
you
were
so
recently
of
them
yourself
they
are
so
confident
that
they
will
run
on
forever
but
they
won
t
run
on
they
don
t
know
that
this
is
all
one
huge
big
blazing
meteor
that
makes
a
pretty
fire
in
space
but
that
some
day
it
ll
have
to
hit
they
see
only
the
blaze
the
pretty
fire
as
you
saw
it
montag
old
men
who
stay
at
home
afraid
tending
their
peanut
brittle
bones
have
no
right
to
criticize
yet
you
almost
killed
things
at
the
start
watch
it
i
m
with
you
remember
that
i
understand
how
it
happened
i
must
admit
that
your
blind
raging
invigorated
me
god
how
young
i
felt
but
now
i
want
you
to
feel
old
i
want
a
little
of
my
cowardice
to
be
distilled
in
you
tonight
the
next
few
hours
when
you
see
captain
beatty
tiptoe
round
him
let
me
hear
him
for
you
let
me
feel
the
situation
out
survival
is
our
ticket
forget
the
poor
silly
women
i
made
them
unhappier
than
they
have
been
in
years
i
think
said
montag
it
shocked
me
to
see
mrs
phelps
cry
maybe
they
re
right
maybe
it
s
best
not
to
face
things
to
run
have
fun
i
don
t
know
i
feel
guilty
no
you
mustn
t
if
there
were
no
war
if
there
was
peace
in
the
world
i
d
say
fine
have
fun
but
montag
you
mustn
t
go
back
to
being
just
a
fireman
all
isn
t
well
with
the
world
montag
perspired
montag
you
listening
my
feet
said
montag
i
can
t
move
them
i
feel
so
damn
silly
my
feet
won
t
move
listen
easy
now
said
the
old
man
gently
i
know
i
know
you
re
afraid
of
making
mistakes
don
t
be
mistakes
can
be
profited
by
man
when
i
was
younger
i
shoved
my
ignorance
in
people
s
faces
they
beat
me
with
sticks
by
the
time
i
was
forty
my
blunt
instrument
had
been
honed
to
a
fine
cutting
point
for
me
if
you
hide
your
ignorance
no
one
will
hit
you
and
you
ll
never
learn
now
pick
up
your
feet
into
the
firehouse
with
you
we
re
twins
we
re
not
alone
any
more
we
re
not
separated
out
in
different
parlors
with
no
contact
between
if
you
need
help
when
beatty
pries
at
you
i
ll
be
sitting
right
here
in
your
eardrum
making
notes
montag
felt
his
right
foot
then
his
left
foot
move
old
man
he
said
stay
with
me
the
mechanical
hound
was
gone
its
kennel
was
empty
and
the
firehouse
stood
all
about
in
plaster
silence
and
the
orange
salamander
slept
with
its
kerosene
in
its
belly
and
the
fire
throwers
crossed
upon
its
flanks
and
montag
came
in
through
the
silence
and
touched
the
brass
pole
and
slid
up
in
the
dark
air
looking
back
at
the
deserted
kennel
his
heart
beating
pausing
beating
faber
was
a
gray
moth
asleep
in
his
ear
for
the
moment
beatty
stood
near
the
drop
hole
waiting
but
with
his
back
turned
as
if
he
were
not
waiting
well
he
said
to
the
men
playing
cards
here
comes
a
very
strange
beast
which
in
all
tongues
is
called
a
fool
he
put
his
hand
to
one
side
palm
up
for
a
gift
montag
put
the
book
in
it
without
even
glancing
at
the
title
beatty
tossed
the
book
in
the
trash
basket
and
lit
a
cigarette
who
are
a
little
wise
the
best
fools
be
welcome
back
montag
i
hope
you
ll
be
staying
with
us
now
that
your
fever
is
done
and
your
sickness
over
sit
in
for
a
hand
of
poker
they
sat
and
the
cards
were
dealt
in
beatty
s
sight
montag
felt
the
guilt
of
his
hands
his
fingers
were
like
ferrets
that
had
done
some
evil
and
now
never
rested
always
stirred
and
picked
and
hid
in
pockets
moving
from
under
beatty
s
alcohol
flame
stare
if
beatty
so
much
as
breathed
on
them
montag
felt
that
his
hands
might
wither
turn
over
on
their
sides
and
never
be
shocked
to
life
"again;"
they
would
be
buried
the
rest
of
his
life
in
his
coat
sleeves
forgotten
for
these
were
the
hands
that
had
acted
on
their
own
no
part
of
him
here
was
where
the
conscience
first
manifested
itself
to
snatch
books
dart
off
with
job
and
ruth
and
willie
shakespeare
and
now
in
the
firehouse
these
hands
seemed
gloved
with
blood
twice
in
half
an
hour
montag
had
to
rise
from
the
game
to
go
to
the
latrine
to
wash
his
hands
when
he
came
back
he
hid
his
hands
under
the
table
beatty
laughed
let
s
have
your
hands
in
sight
montag
not
that
we
don
t
trust
you
understand
but
they
all
laughed
well
said
beatty
the
crisis
is
past
and
all
is
well
the
sheep
returns
to
the
fold
we
re
all
sheep
who
have
strayed
at
times
truth
is
truth
to
the
end
of
reckoning
we
ve
cried
they
are
never
alone

this

again
pope
same
essay
where
does
that
put
you
montag
bit
his
lip
i
ll
tell
you
said
beatty
smiling
at
his
cards
that
made
you
for
a
little
while
a
drunkard
read
a
few
lines
and
off
you
go
over
the
cliff
bang
you
re
ready
to
blow
up
the
world
chop
off
heads
knock
down
women
and
children
destroy
authority
i
know
i
ve
been
through
it
all
i
m
all
right
said
montag
nervously
stop
blushing
i
m
not
needling
really
i
m
not
do
you
know
i
had
a
dream
an
hour
ago
i
lay
down
for
a
catnap
and
in
this
dream
you
and
i
montag
got
into
a
furious
debate
on
books
you
towered
with
rage
yelled
quotes
at
me
i
calmly
parried
every
thrust
tower
i
said
and
you
quoting
dr
johnson
said
knowledge
is
more
than
equivalent
to
force
and
i
said
well
dr
johnson
also
said
dear
boy
that
he
is
no
wise
man
that
will
quit
a
certainty
for
an
uncertainty
stick
with
the
firemen
montag
all
else
is
dreary
chaos
don
t
listen
whispered
faber
he
s
trying
to
confuse
he
s
slippery
watch
out
beatty
chuckled
and
you
said
quoting
truth
will
come
to
light
murder
will
not
be
hid
long
and
i
cried
in
good
humor
oh
god
he
speaks
only
of
his
horse
and
the
devil
can
cite
scripture
for
his
purpose
and
you
yelled
this
age
thinks
better
of
a
gilded
fool
than
of
a
threadbare
saint
in
wisdom
s
school
and
i
whispered
gently
the
dignity
of
truth
is
lost
with
much
protesting
and
you
screamed
carcasses
bleed
at
the
sight
of
the
murderer
and
i
said
patting
your
hand
what
do
i
give
you
trench
mouth
and
you
shrieked
knowledge
is
power
and
a
dwarf
on
a
giant
s
shoulders
sees
the
furthest
of
the
two
and
i
summed
my
side
up
with
rare
serenity
in
the
folly
of
mistaking
a
metaphor
for
a
proof
a
torrent
of
verbiage
for
a
spring
of
capital
truths
and
oneself
as
an
oracle
is
inborn
in
us
mr
valery
once
said
montag
s
head
whirled
sickeningly
he
felt
beaten
unmercifully
on
brow
eyes
nose
lips
chin
on
shoulders
on
upflailing
arms
he
wanted
to
yell
no
shut
up
you
re
confusing
things
stop
it
beatty
s
graceful
fingers
thrust
out
to
seize
his
wrist
god
what
a
pulse
i
ve
got
you
going
have
i
montag
jesus
god
your
pulse
sounds
like
the
day
after
the
war
everything
but
sirens
and
bells
shall
i
talk
some
more
i
like
your
look
of
panic

indian
english
lit
i
speak
them
all
a
kind
of
excellent
dumb
discourse
willie
montag
hold
on
the
moth
brushed
montag
s
ear
he
s
muddying
the
waters
oh
you
were
scared
silly
said
beatty
for
i
was
doing
a
terrible
thing
in
using
the
very
books
you
clung
to
to
rebut
you
on
every
hand
on
every
point
what
traitors
books
can
be
you
think
they
re
backing
you
up
and
they
turn
on
you
others
can
use
them
too
and
there
you
are
lost
in
the
middle
of
the
moor
in
a
great
welter
of
nouns
and
verbs
and
adjectives
and
at
the
very
end
of
my
dream
along
i
came
with
the
salamander
and
said
going
my
way
and
you
got
in
and
we
drove
back
to
the
firehouse
in
beatific
silence
all
dwindled
away
to
peace
beatty
let
montag
s
wrist
go
let
the
hand
slump
limply
on
the
table
all
s
well
that
is
well
in
the
end
silence
montag
sat
like
a
carved
white
stone
the
echo
of
the
final
hammer
on
his
skull
died
slowly
away
into
the
black
cavern
where
faber
waited
for
the
echoes
to
subside
and
then
when
the
startled
dust
had
settled
down
about
montag
s
mind
faber
began
softly
all
right
he
s
had
his
say
you
must
take
it
in
i
ll
say
my
say
too
in
the
next
few
hours
and
you
ll
take
it
in
and
you
ll
try
to
judge
them
and
make
your
decision
as
to
which
way
to
jump
or
fall
but
i
want
it
to
be
your
decision
not
mine
and
not
the
captain
s
but
remember
that
the
captain
belongs
to
the
most
dangerous
enemy
to
truth
and
freedom
the
solid
unmoving
cattle
of
the
majority
oh
god
the
terrible
tyranny
of
the
majority
we
all
have
our
harps
to
play
and
it
s
up
to
you
now
to
know
with
which
ear
you
ll
listen
montag
opened
his
mouth
to
answer
faber
and
was
saved
this
error
in
the
presence
of
others
when
the
station
bell
rang
the
alarm
voice
in
the
ceiling
chanted
there
was
a
tacking
tacking
sound
as
the
alarm
report
telephone
typed
out
the
address
across
the
room
captain
beatty
his
poker
cards
in
one
pink
hand
walked
with
exaggerated
slowness
to
the
phone
and
ripped
out
the
address
when
the
report
was
finished
he
glanced
perfunctorily
at
it
and
shoved
it
in
his
pocket
he
came
back
and
sat
down
the
others
looked
at
him
it
can
wait
exactly
forty
seconds
while
i
take
all
the
money
away
from
you
said
beatty
happily
montag
put
his
cards
down
tired
montag
going
out
of
this
game
yes
hold
on
well
come
to
think
of
it
we
can
finish
this
hand
later
just
leave
your
cards
face
down
and
hustle
the
equipment
on
the
double
now
and
beatty
rose
up
again
montag
you
don
t
look
well
i
d
hate
to
think
you
were
coming
down
with
another
fever
i
ll
be
all
right
you
ll
be
fine
this
is
a
special
case
come
on
jump
for
it
they
leapt
into
the
air
and
clutched
the
brass
pole
as
if
it
were
the
last
vantage
point
above
a
tidal
wave
passing
below
and
then
the
brass
pole
to
their
dismay
slid
them
down
into
darkness
into
the
blast
and
cough
and
suction
of
the
gaseous
dragon
roaring
to
life
hey
they
rounded
a
corner
in
thunder
and
siren
with
concussion
of
tires
with
scream
of
rubber
with
a
shift
of
kerosene
bulk
in
the
glittery
brass
tank
like
the
food
in
the
stomach
of
a
giant
with
montag
s
fingers
jolting
off
the
silver
rail
swinging
into
cold
space
with
the
wind
tearing
his
hair
back
from
his
head
with
the
wind
whistling
in
his
teeth
and
him
all
the
while
thinking
of
the
women
the
chaff
women
in
his
parlor
tonight
with
the
kernels
blown
out
from
under
them
by
a
neon
wind
and
his
silly
damned
reading
of
a
book
to
them
how
like
trying
to
put
out
fires
with
water
pistols
how
senseless
and
insane
one
rage
turned
in
for
another
one
anger
displacing
another
when
would
he
stop
being
entirely
mad
and
be
quiet
be
very
quiet
indeed
here
we
go
montag
looked
up
beatty
never
drove
but
he
was
driving
tonight
slamming
the
salamander
around
corners
leaning
forward
high
on
the
driver
s
throne
his
massive
black
slicker
flapping
out
behind
so
that
he
seemed
a
great
black
bat
flying
above
the
engine
over
the
brass
numbers
taking
the
full
wind
here
we
go
to
keep
the
world
happy
montag
beatty
s
pink
phosphorescent
cheeks
glimmered
in
the
high
darkness
and
he
was
smiling
furiously
here
we
are
the
salamander
boomed
to
a
halt
throwing
men
off
in
slips
and
clumsy
hops
montag
stood
fixing
his
raw
eyes
to
the
cold
bright
rail
under
his
clenched
fingers
i
can
t
do
it
he
thought
how
can
i
go
at
this
new
assignment
how
can
i
go
on
burning
things
i
can
t
go
in
this
place
beatty
smelling
of
the
wind
through
which
he
had
rushed
was
at
montag
s
elbow
all
right
montag
the
men
ran
like
cripples
in
their
clumsy
boots
as
quietly
as
spiders
at
last
montag
raised
his
eyes
and
turned
beatty
was
watching
his
face
something
the
matter
montag
why
said
montag
slowly
we
ve
stopped
in
front
of
my
house
three
burning
bright
lights
flicked
on
and
house
doors
opened
all
down
the
street
to
watch
the
carnival
set
up
montag
and
beatty
stared
one
with
dry
satisfaction
the
other
with
disbelief
at
the
house
before
them
this
main
ring
in
which
torches
would
be
juggled
and
fire
eaten
well
said
beatty
now
you
did
it
old
montag
wanted
to
fly
near
the
sun
and
now
that
he
s
burnt
his
damn
wings
he
wonders
why
didn
t
i
hint
enough
when
i
sent
the
hound
around
your
place
montag
s
face
was
entirely
numb
and
"featureless;"
he
felt
his
head
turn
like
a
stone
carving
to
the
dark
place
next
door
set
in
its
bright
border
of
flowers
beatty
snorted
oh
no
you
weren
t
fooled
by
that
little
idiot
s
routine
now
were
you
flowers
butterflies
leaves
sunsets
oh
hell
it
s
all
in
her
file
i
ll
be
damned
i
ve
hit
the
bull
s
eye
look
at
the
sick
look
on
your
face
a
few
grass
blades
and
the
quarters
of
the
moon
what
trash
what
good
did
she
ever
do
with
all
that
montag
sat
on
the
cold
fender
of
the
dragon
moving
his
head
half
an
inch
to
the
left
half
an
inch
to
the
right
left
right
left
right
left
she
saw
everything
she
didn
t
do
anything
to
anyone
she
just
let
them
alone
alone
hell
she
chewed
around
you
didn
t
she
one
of
those
damn
do
gooders
with
their
shocked
holier
than
thou
silences
their
one
talent
making
others
feel
guilty
god
damn
they
rise
like
the
midnight
sun
to
sweat
you
in
your
bed
the
front
door
"opened;"
mildred
came
down
the
steps
running
one
suitcase
held
with
a
dreamlike
clenching
rigidity
in
her
fist
as
a
beetle
taxi
hissed
to
the
curb
mildred
she
ran
past
with
her
body
stiff
her
face
floured
with
powder
her
mouth
gone
without
lipstick
mildred
you
didn
t
put
in
the
alarm
she
shoved
the
valise
in
the
waiting
beetle
climbed
in
and
sat
mumbling
poor
family
poor
family
oh
everything
gone
everything
everything
gone
now
beatty
grabbed
montag
s
shoulder
as
the
beetle
blasted
away
and
hit
seventy
miles
an
hour
far
down
the
street
gone
there
was
a
crash
like
the
falling
parts
of
a
dream
fashioned
out
of
warped
glass
mirrors
and
crystal
prisms
montag
drifted
about
as
if
still
another
incomprehensible
storm
had
turned
him
to
see
stoneman
and
black
wielding
axes
shattering
windowpanes
to
provide
cross
ventilation
the
brush
of
a
death
s
head
moth
against
a
cold
black
screen
montag
this
is
faber
do
you
hear
me
what
s
happening
this
is
happening
to
me
said
montag
what
a
dreadful
surprise
said
beatty
for
everyone
nowadays
knows
absolutely
is
certain
that
nothing
will
ever
happen
to
me
others
die
i
go
on
there
are
no
consequences
and
no
responsibilities
except
that
there
are
but
let
s
not
talk
about
them
eh
by
the
time
the
consequences
catch
up
with
you
it
s
too
late
isn
t
it
montag
montag
can
you
get
away
run
asked
faber
montag
walked
but
did
not
feel
his
feet
touch
the
cement
and
then
the
night
grasses
beatty
flicked
his
igniter
nearby
and
the
small
orange
flame
drew
his
fascinated
gaze
what
is
there
about
fire
that
s
so
lovely
no
matter
what
age
we
are
what
draws
us
to
it
beatty
blew
out
the
flame
and
lit
it
again
it
s
perpetual
"motion;"
the
thing
man
wanted
to
invent
but
never
did
or
almost
perpetual
motion
if
you
let
it
go
on
it
d
burn
our
lifetimes
out
what
is
fire
it
s
a
mystery
scientists
give
us
gobbledegook
about
friction
and
molecules
but
they
don
t
really
know
its
real
beauty
is
that
it
destroys
responsibility
and
consequences
a
problem
gets
too
burdensome
then
into
the
furnace
with
it
now
montag
you
re
a
burden
and
fire
will
lift
you
off
my
shoulders
clean
quick
"sure;"
nothing
to
rot
later
antibiotic
aesthetic
practical
montag
stood
looking
in
now
at
this
queer
house
made
strange
by
the
hour
of
the
night
by
murmuring
neighbor
voices
by
littered
glass
and
there
on
the
floor
their
covers
torn
off
and
spilled
out
like
swan
feathers
the
incredible
books
that
looked
so
silly
and
really
not
worth
bothering
with
for
these
were
nothing
but
black
type
and
yellowed
paper
and
raveled
binding
mildred
of
course
she
must
have
watched
him
hide
the
books
in
the
garden
and
brought
them
back
in
mildred
mildred
i
want
you
to
do
this
job
all
by
your
lonesome
montag
not
with
kerosene
and
a
match
but
piecework
with
a
flame
thrower
your
house
your
clean
up
montag
can
t
you
run
get
away
no
cried
montag
helplessly
the
hound
because
of
the
hound
faber
heard
and
beatty
thinking
it
was
meant
for
him
heard
yes
the
hound
s
somewhere
about
the
neighborhood
so
don
t
try
anything
ready
ready
montag
snapped
the
safety
catch
on
the
flame
thrower
fire
a
great
nuzzling
gout
of
fire
leapt
out
to
lap
at
the
books
and
knock
them
against
the
wall
he
stepped
into
the
bedroom
and
fired
twice
and
the
twin
beds
went
up
in
a
great
simmering
whisper
with
more
heat
and
passion
and
light
than
he
would
have
supposed
them
to
contain
he
burnt
the
bedroom
walls
and
the
cosmetics
chest
because
he
wanted
to
change
everything
the
chairs
the
tables
and
in
the
dining
room
the
silverware
and
plastic
dishes
everything
that
showed
that
he
had
lived
here
in
this
empty
house
with
a
strange
woman
who
would
forget
him
tomorrow
who
had
gone
and
quite
forgotten
him
already
listening
to
her
seashell
radio
pour
in
on
her
and
in
on
her
as
she
rode
across
town
alone
and
as
before
it
was
good
to
burn
he
felt
himself
gush
out
in
the
fire
snatch
rend
rip
in
half
with
flame
and
put
away
the
senseless
problem
if
there
was
no
solution
well
then
now
there
was
no
problem
either
fire
was
best
for
everything
the
books
montag
the
books
leapt
and
danced
like
roasted
birds
their
wings
ablaze
with
red
and
yellow
feathers
and
then
he
came
to
the
parlor
where
the
great
idiot
monsters
lay
asleep
with
their
white
thoughts
and
their
snowy
dreams
and
he
shot
a
bolt
at
each
of
the
three
blank
walls
and
the
vacuum
hissed
out
at
him
the
emptiness
made
an
even
emptier
whistle
a
senseless
scream
he
tried
to
think
about
the
vacuum
upon
which
the
nothingnesses
had
performed
but
he
could
not
he
held
his
breath
so
the
vacuum
could
not
get
into
his
lungs
he
cut
off
its
terrible
emptiness
drew
back
and
gave
the
entire
room
a
gift
of
one
huge
bright
yellow
flower
of
burning
the
fireproof
plastic
sheath
on
everything
was
cut
wide
and
the
house
began
to
shudder
with
flame
when
you
re
quite
finished
said
beatty
behind
him
you
re
under
arrest
the
house
fell
in
red
coals
and
black
ash
it
bedded
itself
down
in
sleepy
pink
gray
cinders
and
a
smoke
plume
blew
over
it
rising
and
waving
slowly
back
and
forth
in
the
sky
it
was
three
thirty
in
the
morning
the
crowd
drew
back
into
the
"houses;"
the
great
tents
of
the
circus
had
slumped
into
charcoal
and
rubble
and
the
show
was
well
over
montag
stood
with
the
flame
thrower
in
his
limp
hands
great
islands
of
perspiration
drenching
his
armpits
his
face
smeared
with
soot
the
other
firemen
waited
behind
him
in
the
darkness
their
faces
illumined
faintly
by
the
smoldering
foundation
montag
started
to
speak
twice
and
then
finally
managed
to
put
his
thought
together
was
it
my
wife
turned
in
the
alarm
beatty
nodded
but
her
friends
turned
in
an
alarm
earlier
that
i
let
ride
one
way
or
the
other
you
d
have
got
it
it
was
pretty
silly
quoting
poetry
around
free
and
easy
like
that
it
was
the
act
of
a
silly
damn
snob
give
a
man
a
few
lines
of
verse
and
he
thinks
he
s
the
lord
of
all
creation
you
think
you
can
walk
on
water
with
your
books
well
the
world
can
get
by
just
fine
without
them
look
where
they
got
you
in
slime
up
to
your
lip
if
i
stir
the
slime
with
my
little
finger
you
ll
drown
montag
could
not
move
a
great
earthquake
had
come
with
fire
and
leveled
the
house
and
mildred
was
under
there
somewhere
and
his
entire
life
under
there
and
he
could
not
move
the
earthquake
was
still
shaking
and
falling
and
shivering
inside
him
and
he
stood
there
his
knees
half
bent
under
the
great
load
of
tiredness
and
bewilderment
and
outrage
letting
beatty
hit
him
without
raising
a
hand
montag
you
idiot
montag
you
damn
"fool;"
why
did
you
really
do
it
montag
did
not
hear
he
was
far
away
he
was
running
with
his
mind
he
was
gone
leaving
this
dead
soot
covered
body
to
sway
in
front
of
another
raving
fool
montag
get
out
of
there
said
faber
montag
listened
beatty
struck
him
a
blow
on
the
head
that
sent
him
reeling
back
the
green
bullet
in
which
faber
s
voice
whispered
and
cried
fell
to
the
sidewalk
beatty
snatched
it
up
grinning
he
held
it
half
in
half
out
of
his
ear
montag
heard
the
distant
voice
calling
montag
you
all
right
beatty
switched
the
green
bullet
off
and
thrust
it
in
his
pocket
well
so
there
s
more
here
than
i
thought
i
saw
you
tilt
your
head
listening
first
i
thought
you
had
a
seashell
but
when
you
turned
clever
later
i
wondered
we
ll
trace
this
and
drop
in
on
your
friend
no
said
montag
he
twitched
the
safety
catch
on
the
flame
thrower
beatty
glanced
instantly
at
montag
s
fingers
and
his
eyes
widened
the
faintest
bit
montag
saw
the
surprise
there
and
himself
glanced
to
his
hands
to
see
what
new
thing
they
had
done
thinking
back
later
he
could
never
decide
whether
the
hands
or
beatty
s
reaction
to
the
hands
gave
him
the
final
push
toward
murder
the
last
rolling
thunder
of
the
avalanche
stoned
down
about
his
ears
not
touching
him
beatty
grinned
his
most
charming
grin
well
that
s
one
way
to
get
an
audience
hold
a
gun
on
a
man
and
force
him
to
listen
to
your
speech
speech
away
what
ll
it
be
this
time
why
don
t
you
belch
shakespeare
at
me
you
fumbling
snob
there
is
no
terror
cassius
in
your
threats
for
i
am
arm
d
so
strong
in
honesty
that
they
pass
by
me
as
an
idle
wind
which
i
respect
not
how
s
that
go
ahead
now
you
second
hand
literateur
pull
the
trigger
he
took
one
step
toward
montag
montag
only
said
we
never
burned
right
hand
it
over
guy
said
beatty
with
a
fixed
smile
and
then
he
was
a
shrieking
blaze
a
jumping
sprawling
gibbering
manikin
no
longer
human
or
known
all
writhing
flame
on
the
lawn
as
montag
shot
one
continuous
pulse
of
liquid
fire
on
him
there
was
a
hiss
like
a
great
mouthful
of
spittle
banging
a
red
hot
stove
a
bubbling
and
frothing
as
if
salt
had
been
poured
over
a
monstrous
black
snail
to
cause
a
terrible
liquefaction
and
a
boiling
over
of
yellow
foam
montag
shut
his
eyes
shouted
shouted
and
fought
to
get
his
hands
at
his
ears
to
clamp
and
to
cut
away
the
sound
beatty
flopped
over
and
over
and
over
and
at
last
twisted
in
on
himself
like
a
charred
wax
doll
and
lay
silent
the
other
two
firemen
did
not
move
montag
kept
his
sickness
down
long
enough
to
aim
the
flame
thrower
turn
around
they
turned
their
faces
like
blanched
meat
streaming
"sweat;"
he
beat
their
heads
knocking
off
their
helmets
and
bringing
them
down
on
themselves
they
fell
and
lay
without
moving
the
blowing
of
a
single
autumn
leaf
he
turned
and
the
mechanical
hound
was
there
it
was
half
across
the
lawn
coming
from
the
shadows
moving
with
such
drifting
ease
that
it
was
like
a
single
solid
cloud
of
black
gray
smoke
blown
at
him
in
silence
it
made
a
single
last
leap
into
the
air
coming
down
at
montag
from
a
good
three
feet
over
his
head
its
spidered
legs
reaching
the
procaine
needle
snapping
out
its
single
angry
tooth
montag
caught
it
with
a
bloom
of
fire
a
single
wondrous
blossom
that
curled
in
petals
of
yellow
and
blue
and
orange
about
the
metal
dog
clad
it
in
a
new
covering
as
it
slammed
into
montag
and
threw
him
ten
feet
back
against
the
bole
of
a
tree
taking
the
flame
gun
with
him
he
felt
it
scrabble
and
seize
his
leg
and
stab
the
needle
in
for
a
moment
before
the
fire
snapped
the
hound
up
in
the
air
burst
its
metal
bones
at
the
joints
and
blew
out
its
interior
in
a
single
flushing
of
red
color
like
a
skyrocket
fastened
to
the
street
montag
lay
watching
the
dead
alive
thing
fiddle
the
air
and
die
even
now
it
seemed
to
want
to
get
back
at
him
and
finish
the
injection
which
was
now
working
through
the
flesh
of
his
leg
he
felt
all
of
the
mingled
relief
and
horror
at
having
pulled
back
only
in
time
to
have
just
his
knee
slammed
by
the
fender
of
a
car
hurtling
by
at
ninety
miles
an
hour
he
was
afraid
to
get
up
afraid
he
might
not
be
able
to
gain
his
feet
at
all
with
an
anesthetized
leg
a
numbness
in
a
numbness
hollowed
into
a
numbness
and
now
the
street
empty
the
house
burnt
like
an
ancient
bit
of
stage
scenery
the
other
homes
dark
the
hound
here
beatty
there
the
three
other
firemen
another
place
and
the
salamander
he
gazed
at
the
immense
engine
that
would
have
to
go
too
well
he
thought
let
s
see
how
badly
off
you
are
on
your
feet
now
easy
easy
there
he
stood
and
he
had
only
one
leg
the
other
was
like
a
chunk
of
burnt
pine
log
he
was
carrying
along
as
a
penance
for
some
obscure
sin
when
he
put
his
weight
on
it
a
shower
of
silver
needles
gushed
up
the
length
of
the
calf
and
went
off
in
the
knee
he
wept
come
on
come
on
you
you
can
t
stay
here
a
few
house
lights
were
going
on
again
down
the
street
whether
from
the
incidents
just
passed
or
because
of
the
abnormal
silence
following
the
fight
montag
did
not
know
he
hobbled
around
the
ruins
seizing
at
his
bad
leg
when
it
lagged
talking
and
whimpering
and
shouting
directions
at
it
and
cursing
it
and
pleading
with
it
to
work
for
him
now
when
it
was
vital
he
heard
a
number
of
people
crying
out
in
the
darkness
and
shouting
he
reached
the
back
yard
and
the
alley
beatty
he
thought
you
re
not
a
problem
now
you
always
said
don
t
face
a
problem
burn
it
well
now
i
ve
done
both
goodbye
captain
and
he
stumbled
along
the
alley
in
the
dark
a
shotgun
blast
went
off
in
his
leg
every
time
he
put
it
down
and
he
thought
you
re
a
fool
a
damn
fool
an
awful
fool
an
idiot
an
awful
idiot
a
damn
idiot
and
a
fool
a
damn
"fool;"
look
at
the
mess
and
where
s
the
mop
look
at
the
mess
and
what
do
you
do
pride
damn
it
and
temper
and
you
ve
junked
it
all
at
the
very
start
you
vomit
on
everyone
and
on
yourself
but
everything
at
once
but
everything
one
on
top
of
another
beatty
the
women
mildred
clarisse
everything
no
excuse
though
no
excuse
a
fool
a
damn
fool
go
give
yourself
up
no
we
ll
save
what
we
can
we
ll
do
what
there
is
left
to
do
if
we
have
to
burn
let
s
take
a
few
more
with
us
here
he
remembered
the
books
and
turned
back
just
on
the
off
chance
he
found
a
few
books
where
he
had
left
them
near
the
garden
fence
mildred
god
bless
her
had
missed
a
few
four
books
still
lay
hidden
where
he
had
put
them
voices
were
wailing
in
the
night
and
flashbeams
swirled
about
other
salamanders
were
roaring
their
engines
far
away
and
police
sirens
were
cutting
their
way
across
town
with
their
sirens
montag
took
the
four
remaining
books
and
hopped
jolted
hopped
his
way
down
the
alley
and
suddenly
fell
as
if
his
head
had
been
cut
off
and
only
his
body
lay
there
something
inside
had
jerked
him
to
a
halt
and
flopped
him
down
he
lay
where
he
had
fallen
and
sobbed
his
legs
folded
his
face
pressed
blindly
to
the
gravel
beatty
wanted
to
die
in
the
middle
of
the
crying
montag
knew
it
for
the
truth
beatty
had
wanted
to
die
he
had
just
stood
there
not
really
trying
to
save
himself
just
stood
there
joking
needling
thought
montag
and
the
thought
was
enough
to
stifle
his
sobbing
and
let
him
pause
for
air
how
strange
strange
to
want
to
die
so
much
that
you
let
a
man
walk
around
armed
and
then
instead
of
shutting
up
and
staying
alive
you
go
on
yelling
at
people
and
making
fun
of
them
until
you
get
them
mad
and
then
at
a
distance
running
feet
montag
sat
up
let
s
get
out
of
here
come
on
get
up
get
up
you
just
can
t
sit
but
he
was
still
crying
and
that
had
to
be
finished
it
was
going
away
now
he
hadn
t
wanted
to
kill
anyone
not
even
beatty
his
flesh
gripped
him
and
shrank
as
if
it
had
been
plunged
in
acid
he
gagged
he
saw
beatty
a
torch
not
moving
fluttering
out
on
the
grass
he
bit
at
his
knuckles
i
m
sorry
i
m
sorry
oh
god
sorry
he
tried
to
piece
it
all
together
to
go
back
to
the
normal
pattern
of
life
a
few
short
days
ago
before
the
sieve
and
the
sand
denham
s
dentifrice
moth
voices
fireflies
the
alarms
and
excursions
too
much
for
a
few
short
days
too
much
indeed
for
a
lifetime
feet
ran
in
the
far
end
of
the
alley
get
up
he
told
himself
damn
it
get
up
he
said
to
the
leg
and
stood
the
pains
were
spikes
driven
in
the
kneecap
and
then
only
darning
needles
and
then
only
common
ordinary
safety
pins
and
after
he
had
shagged
along
fifty
more
hops
and
jumps
filling
his
hand
with
slivers
from
the
board
fence
the
prickling
was
like
someone
blowing
a
spray
of
scalding
water
on
that
leg
and
the
leg
was
at
last
his
own
leg
again
he
had
been
afraid
that
running
might
break
the
loose
ankle
now
sucking
all
the
night
into
his
open
mouth
and
blowing
it
out
pale
with
all
the
blackness
left
heavily
inside
himself
he
set
out
in
a
steady
jogging
pace
he
carried
the
books
in
his
hands
he
thought
of
faber
faber
was
back
there
in
the
steaming
lump
of
tar
that
had
no
name
or
identity
now
he
had
burnt
faber
too
he
felt
so
suddenly
shocked
by
this
that
he
felt
faber
was
really
dead
baked
like
a
roach
in
that
small
green
capsule
shoved
and
lost
in
the
pocket
of
a
man
who
was
now
nothing
but
a
frame
skeleton
strung
with
asphalt
tendons
you
must
remember
burn
them
or
they
ll
burn
you
he
thought
right
now
it
s
as
simple
as
that
he
searched
his
pockets
the
money
was
there
and
in
his
other
pocket
he
found
the
usual
seashell
upon
which
the
city
was
talking
to
itself
in
the
cold
black
morning
police
alert
wanted:
fugitive
in
city
has
committed
murder
and
crimes
against
the
state
name:
guy
montag
occupation:
fireman
last
seen
he
ran
steadily
for
six
blocks
in
the
alley
and
then
the
alley
opened
out
onto
a
wide
empty
thoroughfare
ten
lanes
wide
it
seemed
like
a
boatless
river
frozen
there
in
the
raw
light
of
the
high
white
arc
"lamps;"
you
could
drown
trying
to
cross
it
he
"felt;"
it
was
too
wide
it
was
too
open
it
was
a
vast
stage
without
scenery
inviting
him
to
run
across
easily
seen
in
the
blazing
illumination
easily
caught
easily
shot
down
the
seashell
hummed
in
his
ear
watch
for
a
man
running
watch
for
the
running
man
watch
for
a
man
alone
on
foot
watch
montag
pulled
back
in
the
shadows
directly
ahead
lay
a
gas
station
a
great
chunk
of
porcelain
snow
shining
there
and
two
silver
beetles
pulling
in
to
fill
up
now
he
must
be
clean
and
presentable
if
he
wished
to
walk
not
run
stroll
calmly
across
that
wide
boulevard
it
would
give
him
an
extra
margin
of
safety
if
he
washed
up
and
combed
his
hair
before
he
went
on
his
way
to
get
where
yes
he
thought
where
am
i
running
nowhere
there
was
nowhere
to
go
no
friend
to
turn
to
really
except
faber
and
then
he
realized
that
he
was
indeed
running
toward
faber
s
house
instinctively
but
faber
couldn
t
hide
"him;"
it
would
be
suicide
even
to
try
but
he
knew
that
he
would
go
to
see
faber
anyway
for
a
few
short
minutes
faber
s
would
be
the
place
where
he
might
refuel
his
fast
draining
belief
in
his
own
ability
to
survive
he
just
wanted
to
know
that
there
was
a
man
like
faber
in
the
world
he
wanted
to
see
the
man
alive
and
not
burned
back
there
like
a
body
shelled
in
another
body
and
some
of
the
money
must
be
left
with
faber
of
course
to
be
spent
after
montag
ran
on
his
way
perhaps
he
could
make
the
open
country
and
live
on
or
near
the
rivers
and
near
the
highways
in
the
fields
and
hills
a
great
whirling
whisper
made
him
look
to
the
sky
the
police
helicopters
were
rising
so
far
away
that
it
seemed
someone
had
blown
the
gray
head
off
a
dry
dandelion
flower
two
dozen
of
them
flurried
wavering
indecisive
three
miles
off
like
butterflies
puzzled
by
autumn
and
then
they
were
plummeting
down
to
land
one
by
one
here
there
softly
kneading
the
streets
where
turned
back
to
beetles
they
shrieked
along
the
boulevards
or
as
suddenly
leapt
back
into
the
air
continuing
their
search
and
here
was
the
gas
station
its
attendants
busy
now
with
customers
approaching
from
the
rear
montag
entered
the
men
s
washroom
through
the
aluminum
wall
he
heard
a
radio
voice
saying
war
has
been
declared
the
gas
was
being
pumped
outside
the
men
in
the
beetles
were
talking
and
the
attendants
were
talking
about
the
engines
the
gas
the
money
owed
montag
stood
trying
to
make
himself
feel
the
shock
of
the
quiet
statement
from
the
radio
but
nothing
would
happen
the
war
would
have
to
wait
for
him
to
come
to
it
in
his
personal
file
an
hour
two
hours
from
now
he
washed
his
hands
and
face
and
toweled
himself
dry
making
little
sound
he
came
out
of
the
washroom
and
shut
the
door
carefully
and
walked
into
the
darkness
and
at
last
stood
again
on
the
edge
of
the
empty
boulevard
there
it
lay
a
game
for
him
to
win
a
vast
bowling
alley
in
the
cool
morning
the
boulevard
was
as
clean
as
the
surface
of
an
arena
two
minutes
before
the
appearance
of
certain
unnamed
victims
and
certain
unknown
killers
the
air
over
and
above
the
vast
concrete
river
trembled
with
the
warmth
of
montag
s
body
"alone;"
it
was
incredible
how
he
felt
his
temperature
could
cause
the
whole
immediate
world
to
vibrate
he
was
a
phosphorescent
"target;"
he
knew
it
he
felt
it
and
now
he
must
begin
his
little
walk
three
blocks
away
a
few
headlights
glared
montag
drew
a
deep
breath
his
lungs
were
like
burning
brooms
in
his
chest
his
mouth
was
sucked
dry
from
running
his
throat
tasted
of
bloody
iron
and
there
was
rusted
steel
in
his
feet
what
about
those
lights
there
once
you
started
walking
you
d
have
to
gauge
how
fast
those
beetles
could
make
it
down
here
well
how
far
was
it
to
the
other
curb
it
seemed
like
a
hundred
yards
probably
not
a
hundred
but
figure
for
that
anyway
figure
that
with
him
going
very
slowly
at
a
nice
stroll
it
might
take
as
much
as
thirty
seconds
forty
seconds
to
walk
all
that
way
the
beetles
once
started
they
could
leave
three
blocks
behind
them
in
about
fifteen
seconds
so
even
if
halfway
across
he
started
to
run
he
put
his
right
foot
out
and
then
his
left
foot
and
then
his
right
he
walked
on
the
empty
avenue
even
if
the
street
were
entirely
empty
of
course
you
couldn
t
be
sure
of
a
safe
crossing
for
a
car
could
appear
suddenly
over
the
rise
four
blocks
further
on
and
be
on
and
past
you
before
you
had
taken
a
dozen
breaths
he
decided
not
to
count
his
steps
he
looked
neither
to
left
nor
right
the
light
from
the
overhead
lamps
seemed
as
bright
and
revealing
as
the
midday
sun
and
just
as
hot
he
listened
to
the
sound
of
the
car
picking
up
speed
two
blocks
away
on
his
right
its
movable
headlights
jerked
back
and
forth
suddenly
and
caught
at
montag
keep
going
montag
faltered
got
a
grip
on
the
books
and
forced
himself
not
to
freeze
instinctively
he
took
a
few
quick
running
steps
then
talked
out
loud
to
himself
and
pulled
up
to
stroll
again
he
was
now
half
across
the
street
but
the
roar
from
the
beetle
s
engines
whined
higher
as
it
put
on
speed
the
police
of
course
they
see
me
but
slow
now
slow
quiet
don
t
turn
don
t
look
don
t
seem
concerned
walk
that
s
it
walk
walk
the
beetle
was
rushing
the
beetle
was
roaring
the
beetle
raised
its
speed
the
beetle
was
whining
the
beetle
was
in
high
thunder
the
beetle
came
skimming
the
beetle
came
in
a
single
whistling
trajectory
fired
from
an
invisible
rifle
it
was
up
to
120
mph
it
was
up
to
at
least
montag
clamped
his
jaws
the
heat
of
the
racing
headlights
burnt
his
cheeks
it
seemed
and
jittered
his
eyelids
and
flushed
the
sour
sweat
out
all
over
his
body
he
began
to
shuffle
idiotically
and
talk
to
himself
and
then
he
broke
and
just
ran
he
put
out
his
legs
as
far
as
they
would
go
and
down
and
then
far
out
again
and
down
and
back
and
out
and
down
and
back
god
god
he
dropped
a
book
broke
pace
almost
turned
chan
ged
his
mind
plunged
on
yelling
in
concrete
emptiness
the
beetle
scuttling
after
its
running
food
two
hundred
one
hundred
feet
away
ninety
eighty
seventy
montag
gasping
flailing
his
hands
legs
up
down
out
up
down
out
closer
closer
hooting
calling
his
eyes
burnt
white
now
as
his
head
jerked
about
to
confront
the
flashing
glare
now
the
beetle
was
swallowed
in
its
own
light
now
it
was
nothing
but
a
torch
hurtling
upon
"him;"
all
sound
all
blare
now
almost
on
top
of
him
he
stumbled
and
fell
i
m
done
it
s
over
but
the
falling
made
a
difference
an
instant
before
reaching
him
the
wild
beetle
cut
and
swerved
out
it
was
gone
montag
lay
flat
his
head
down
wisps
of
laughter
trailed
back
to
him
with
the
blue
exhaust
from
the
beetle
his
right
hand
was
extended
above
him
flat
across
the
extreme
tip
of
his
middle
finger
he
saw
now
as
he
lifted
that
hand
a
faint
sixteenth
of
an
inch
of
black
tread
where
the
tire
had
touched
in
passing
he
looked
at
that
black
line
with
disbelief
getting
to
his
feet
that
wasn
t
the
police
he
thought
he
looked
down
the
boulevard
it
was
clear
now
a
carful
of
children
all
ages
god
knew
from
twelve
to
sixteen
out
whistling
yelling
hurrahing
had
seen
a
man
a
very
extraordinary
sight
a
man
strolling
a
rarity
and
simply
said
let
s
get
him
not
knowing
he
was
the
fugitive
mr
montag
simply
a
number
of
children
out
for
a
long
night
of
roaring
five
or
six
hundred
miles
in
a
few
moonlit
hours
their
faces
icy
with
wind
and
coming
home
or
not
coming
at
dawn
alive
or
not
alive
that
made
the
adventure
they
would
have
killed
me
thought
montag
swaying
the
air
still
torn
and
stirring
about
him
in
dust
touching
his
bruised
cheek
for
no
reason
at
all
in
the
world
they
would
have
killed
me
he
walked
toward
the
far
curb
telling
each
foot
to
go
and
keep
going
somehow
he
had
picked
up
the
spilled
"books;"
he
didn
t
remember
bending
or
touching
them
he
kept
moving
them
from
hand
to
hand
as
if
they
were
a
poker
hand
he
could
not
figure
i
wonder
if
they
were
the
ones
who
killed
clarisse
he
stopped
and
his
mind
said
it
again
very
loud
i
wonder
if
they
were
the
ones
who
killed
clarisse
he
wanted
to
run
after
them
yelling
his
eyes
watered
the
thing
that
had
saved
him
was
falling
flat
the
driver
of
that
car
seeing
montag
down
instinctively
considered
the
probability
that
running
over
a
body
at
such
a
high
speed
might
turn
the
car
upside
down
and
spill
them
out
if
montag
had
remained
an
upright
target
montag
gasped
far
down
the
boulevard
four
blocks
way
the
beetle
had
slowed
spun
about
on
two
wheels
and
was
now
racing
back
slanting
over
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
street
picking
up
speed
but
montag
was
gone
hidden
in
the
safety
of
the
dark
alley
for
which
he
had
set
out
on
a
long
journey
an
hour
or
was
it
a
minute
ago
he
stood
shivering
in
the
night
looking
back
out
as
the
beetle
ran
by
and
skidded
back
to
the
center
of
the
avenue
whirling
laughter
in
the
air
all
about
it
gone
further
on
as
montag
moved
in
darkness
he
could
see
the
helicopters
falling
falling
like
the
first
flakes
of
snow
in
the
long
winter
to
come
the
house
was
silent
montag
approached
from
the
rear
creeping
through
a
thick
night
moistened
scent
of
daffodils
and
roses
and
wet
grass
he
touched
the
screen
door
in
back
found
it
open
slipped
in
moved
across
the
porch
listening
mrs
black
are
you
asleep
in
there
he
thought
this
isn
t
good
but
your
husband
did
it
to
others
and
never
asked
and
never
wondered
and
never
worried
and
now
since
you
re
a
fireman
s
wife
it
s
your
house
and
your
turn
for
all
the
houses
your
husband
burned
and
the
people
he
hurt
without
thinking
the
house
did
not
reply
he
hid
the
books
in
the
kitchen
and
moved
from
the
house
again
to
the
alley
and
looked
back
and
the
house
was
still
dark
and
quiet
sleeping
on
his
way
across
town
with
the
helicopters
fluttering
like
torn
bits
of
paper
in
the
sky
he
phoned
the
alarm
at
a
lonely
phone
booth
outside
a
store
that
was
closed
for
the
night
then
he
stood
in
the
cold
night
air
waiting
and
at
a
distance
he
heard
the
fire
sirens
start
up
and
run
and
the
salamanders
coming
coming
to
burn
mr
black
s
house
while
he
was
away
at
work
to
make
his
wife
stand
shivering
in
the
morning
air
while
the
roof
let
go
and
dropped
in
upon
the
fire
but
now
she
was
still
asleep
good
night
mrs
black
he
thought
faber
another
rap
a
whisper
and
a
long
waiting
then
after
a
minute
a
small
light
flickered
inside
faber
s
small
house
after
another
pause
the
back
door
opened
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
the
half
light
faber
and
montag
as
if
each
did
not
believe
in
the
other
s
existence
then
faber
moved
and
put
out
his
hand
and
grabbed
montag
and
moved
him
in
and
sat
him
down
and
went
back
and
stood
in
the
door
listening
the
sirens
were
wailing
off
in
the
morning
distance
he
came
in
and
shut
the
door
montag
said
i
ve
been
a
fool
all
down
the
line
i
can
t
stay
long
i
m
on
my
way
god
knows
where
at
least
you
were
a
fool
about
the
right
things
said
faber
i
thought
you
were
dead
the
audio
capsule
i
gave
you
burnt
i
heard
the
captain
talking
to
you
and
suddenly
there
was
nothing
i
almost
came
out
looking
for
you
the
captain
s
dead
he
found
the
audio
capsule
he
heard
your
voice
he
was
going
to
trace
it
i
killed
him
with
the
flame
thrower
faber
sat
down
and
did
not
speak
for
a
time
my
god
how
did
this
happen
said
montag
it
was
only
the
other
night
everything
was
fine
and
the
next
thing
i
know
i
m
drowning
how
many
times
can
a
man
go
down
and
still
be
alive
i
can
t
breathe
there
s
beatty
dead
and
he
was
my
friend
once
and
there
s
millie
gone
i
thought
she
was
my
wife
but
now
i
don
t
know
and
the
house
all
burnt
and
my
job
gone
and
myself
on
the
run
and
i
planted
a
book
in
a
fireman
s
house
on
the
way
good
christ
the
things
i
ve
done
in
a
single
week
you
did
what
you
had
to
do
it
was
coming
on
for
a
long
time
yes
i
believe
that
if
there
s
nothing
else
i
believe
it
saved
itself
up
to
happen
i
could
feel
it
for
a
long
time
i
was
saving
something
up
i
went
around
doing
one
thing
and
feeling
another
god
it
was
all
there
it
s
a
wonder
it
didn
t
show
on
me
like
fat
and
now
here
i
am
messing
up
your
life
too
they
might
follow
me
here
i
feel
alive
for
the
first
time
in
years
said
faber
i
feel
i
m
doing
what
i
should
ve
done
a
lifetime
ago
for
a
little
while
i
m
not
afraid
maybe
it
s
because
i
m
doing
the
right
thing
at
last
maybe
it
s
because
i
ve
done
a
rash
thing
and
don
t
want
to
look
the
coward
to
you
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
do
even
more
violent
things
exposing
myself
so
i
won
t
fall
down
on
the
job
and
turn
scared
again
what
are
your
plans
to
keep
running
you
know
the
war
s
on
i
heard
god
isn
t
it
funny
said
the
old
man
it
seems
so
remote
because
we
have
our
own
troubles
i
haven
t
had
time
to
think
montag
drew
out
a
hundred
dollars
i
want
this
to
stay
with
you
use
it
any
way
that
ll
help
when
i
m
gone
but
i
might
be
dead
by
"noon;"
use
this
faber
nodded
you
d
better
head
for
the
river
if
you
can
follow
along
it
and
if
you
can
hit
the
old
railroad
lines
going
out
into
the
country
follow
them
even
though
practically
everything
s
air
borne
these
days
and
most
of
the
tracks
are
abandoned
the
rails
are
still
there
rusting
i
ve
heard
there
are
still
hobo
camps
all
across
the
country
here
and
"there;"
walking
camps
they
call
them
and
if
you
keep
walking
far
enough
and
keep
an
eye
peeled
they
say
there
s
lots
of
old
harvard
degrees
on
the
tracks
between
here
and
los
angeles
most
of
them
are
wanted
and
hunted
in
the
cities
they
survive
i
guess
there
aren
t
many
of
them
and
i
guess
the
government
s
never
considered
them
a
great
enough
danger
to
go
in
and
track
them
down
you
might
hole
up
with
them
for
a
time
and
get
in
touch
with
me
in
st
louis
i
m
leaving
on
the
five
a
m
bus
this
morning
to
see
a
retired
printer
there
i
m
getting
out
in
the
open
myself
at
last
this
money
will
be
put
to
good
use
thanks
and
god
bles
s
you
do
you
want
to
sleep
a
few
minutes
i
d
better
run
let
s
check
he
took
montag
quickly
into
the
bedroom
and
lifted
a
picture
frame
aside
revealing
a
television
screen
the
size
of
a
postal
card
i
always
wanted
something
very
small
something
i
could
walk
to
something
i
could
blot
out
with
the
palm
of
my
hand
if
necessary
nothing
that
could
shout
me
down
nothing
monstrous
big
so
you
see
he
snapped
it
on
montag
the
tv
set
said
and
lit
up
m
o
n
t
a
g
the
name
was
spelled
out
by
a
voice
guy
montag
still
running
police
helicopters
are
up
a
new
mechanical
hound
has
been
brought
from
another
disctrict
montag
and
faber
looked
at
each
other
mechanical
hound
never
fails
never
since
its
first
use
in
tracking
quarry
has
this
incredible
invention
made
a
mistake
tonight
this
network
is
proud
to
have
the
opportunity
to
follow
the
hound
by
camera
helicopter
as
it
starts
on
its
way
to
the
target
faber
poured
two
glasses
of
whiskey
we
ll
need
these
they
drank
nose
so
sensitive
the
mechanical
hound
can
remember
and
identify
ten
thousand
odor
indexes
on
ten
thousand
men
without
resetting
faber
trembled
the
least
bit
and
looked
about
at
his
house
at
the
walls
the
door
the
doorknob
and
the
chair
where
montag
now
sat
montag
saw
the
look
they
both
looked
quickly
about
the
house
and
montag
felt
his
nostrils
dilate
and
he
knew
that
he
was
trying
to
track
himself
and
his
nose
was
suddenly
good
enough
to
sense
the
path
he
had
made
in
the
air
of
the
room
and
the
sweat
of
his
hand
hung
from
the
doorknob
invisible
but
as
numerous
as
the
jewels
of
a
small
chandelier
he
was
everywhere
in
and
on
and
about
everything
he
was
a
luminous
cloud
a
ghost
that
made
breathing
once
more
impossible
he
saw
faber
stop
up
his
own
breath
for
fear
of
drawing
that
ghost
into
his
own
body
perhaps
being
contaminated
with
the
phantom
exhalations
and
odors
of
a
running
man
the
mechanical
hound
is
now
landing
by
helicopter
at
the
site
of
the
burning
and
there
on
the
small
screen
was
the
burnt
house
and
the
crowd
and
something
with
a
sheet
over
it
and
out
of
the
sky
fluttering
came
the
helicopter
like
a
grotesque
flower
so
they
must
have
their
game
out
thought
montag
the
circus
must
go
on
even
with
war
beginning
within
the
hour
he
watched
the
scene
fascinated
not
wanting
to
move
it
seemed
so
remote
and
no
part
of
"him;"
it
was
a
play
apart
and
separate
wondrous
to
watch
not
without
its
strange
pleasure
that
s
all
for
me
you
thought
that
s
all
taking
place
just
for
me
by
god
if
he
wished
he
could
linger
here
in
comfort
and
follow
the
entire
hunt
on
through
its
swift
phases
down
alleys
across
streets
over
empty
running
avenues
crossing
lots
and
playgrounds
with
pauses
here
or
there
for
the
necessary
commercials
up
other
alleys
to
the
burning
house
of
mr
and
mrs
black
and
so
on
finally
to
this
house
with
faber
and
himself
seated
drinking
while
the
electric
hound
snuffed
down
the
last
trail
silent
as
a
drift
of
death
itself
skidding
to
a
halt
outside
that
window
there
then
if
he
wished
montag
might
rise
walk
to
the
window
keep
one
eye
on
the
tv
screen
open
the
window
lean
out
look
back
and
see
himself
dramatized
described
made
over
standing
there
limned
in
the
bright
small
television
screen
from
outside
a
drama
to
be
watched
objectively
knowing
that
in
other
parlors
he
was
large
as
life
in
full
color
dimensionally
perfect
and
if
he
kept
his
eye
peeled
quickly
he
would
see
himself
an
instant
before
oblivion
being
punctured
for
the
benefit
of
how
many
civilian
parlor
sitters
who
had
been
wakened
from
sleep
a
few
minutes
ago
by
the
frantic
sirening
of
their
living
room
walls
to
come
watch
the
big
game
the
hunt
the
one
man
carnival
would
he
have
time
for
a
speech
as
the
hound
seized
him
in
view
of
ten
or
twenty
or
thirty
million
people
mightn
t
he
sum
up
his
entire
life
in
the
last
week
in
one
single
phrase
or
a
word
that
would
stay
with
them
long
after
the
hound
had
turned
clenching
him
in
its
metal
plier
jaws
and
trotted
off
in
darkness
while
the
camera
remained
stationary
watching
the
creature
dwindle
in
the
distance
a
splendid
fade
out
what
could
he
say
in
a
single
word
a
few
words
that
would
sear
all
their
faces
and
wake
them
up
there
whispered
faber
out
of
a
helicopter
glided
something
that
was
not
machine
not
animal
not
dead
not
alive
glowing
with
a
pale
green
luminosity
it
stood
near
the
smoking
ruins
of
montag
s
house
and
the
men
brought
his
discarded
flame
thrower
to
it
and
put
it
down
under
the
muzzle
of
the
hound
there
was
a
whirring
clicking
humming
montag
shook
his
head
and
got
up
and
drank
the
rest
of
his
drink
it

time
i

and

faber
was
gone
and
back
in
a
minute
they
sealed
the
cardboard
valise
with
clear
tape
to
keep
the
ancient
odor
of
mr
faber
in
of
course
said
faber
sweating
at
the
job
montag
doused
the
exterior
of
the
valise
with
whiskey
i
don
t
want
that
hound
picking
up
two
odors
at
once
may
i
take
this
whiskey
i
ll
need
it
later
christ
i
hope
this
works
they
shook
hands
again
and
going
out
the
door
glanced
at
the
tv
the
hound
was
on
its
way
followed
by
hovering
helicopter
cameras
silently
silently
sniffing
the
great
night
wind
it
was
running
down
the
first
alley
goodbye
and
montag
was
out
the
back
door
lightly
running
with
the
half
empty
valise
behind
him
he
heard
the
lawn
sprinkling
system
jump
up
filling
the
dark
air
with
rain
that
fell
gently
and
then
with
a
steady
pour
all
about
washing
on
the
sidewalks
and
draining
into
the
alley
he
carried
a
few
drops
of
this
rain
with
him
on
his
face
he
thought
he
heard
the
old
man
call
goodbye
but
he
wasn
t
certain
he
ran
very
fast
away
from
the
house
down
toward
the
river
montag
ran
he
could
feel
the
hound
like
autumn
come
cold
and
dry
and
swift
like
a
wind
that
didn
t
stir
grass
that
didn
t
jar
windows
or
disturb
leaf
shadows
on
the
white
sidewalks
as
it
passed
the
hound
did
not
touch
the
world
it
carried
its
silence
with
it
so
you
could
feel
the
silence
building
up
a
pressure
behind
you
all
across
town
montag
felt
the
pressure
rising
and
ran
he
stopped
for
breath
on
his
way
to
the
river
to
peer
through
dimly
lit
windows
of
wakened
houses
and
saw
the
silhouettes
of
people
inside
watching
their
parlor
walls
and
there
on
the
walls
the
mechanical
hound
a
breath
of
neon
vapor
spidered
along
here
and
gone
here
and
gone
now
at
elm
terrace
lincoln
oak
park
and
up
the
alley
toward
faber
s
house
go
past
thought
montag
don
t
stop
go
on
don
t
turn
in
on
the
parlor
wall
faber
s
house
with
its
sprinkler
system
pulsing
in
the
night
air
the
hound
paused
quivering
no
montag
held
to
the
windowsill
this
way
here
the
procaine
needle
flicked
out
and
in
out
and
in
a
single
clear
drop
of
the
stuff
of
dreams
fell
from
the
needle
as
it
vanished
in
the
hound
s
muzzle
montag
held
his
breath
like
a
doubled
fist
in
his
chest
the
mechanical
hound
turned
and
plunged
away
from
faber
s
house
down
the
alley
again
montag
snapped
his
gaze
to
the
sky
the
helicopters
were
closer
a
great
blowing
of
insects
to
a
single
light
source
with
an
effort
montag
reminded
himself
again
that
this
was
no
fictional
episode
to
be
watched
on
his
run
to
the
"river;"
it
was
in
actuality
his
own
chess
game
he
was
witnessing
move
by
move
he
shouted
to
give
himself
the
necessary
push
away
from
this
last
house
window
and
the
fascinating
seance
going
on
in
there
hell
and
he
was
away
and
gone
the
alley
a
street
the
alley
a
street
and
the
smell
of
the
river
leg
out
leg
down
leg
out
and
down
twenty
million
montags
running
soon
if
the
cameras
caught
him
twenty
million
montags
running
running
like
an
ancient
flickery
keystone
comedy
cops
robbers
chasers
and
the
chased
hunters
and
hunted
he
had
seen
it
a
thousand
times
behind
him
now
twenty
million
silently
baying
hounds
ricocheted
across
parlors
three
cushion
shooting
from
right
wall
to
center
wall
to
left
wall
gone
right
wall
center
wall
left
wall
gone
montag
jammed
his
seashell
to
his
ear:
police
suggest
entire
population
in
the
elm
terrace
area
do
as
follows:
everyone
in
every
house
in
every
street
open
a
front
or
rear
door
or
look
from
the
windows
the
fugitive
cannot
escape
if
everyone
in
the
next
minute
looks
from
his
house
ready
of
course
why
hadn
t
they
done
it
before
why
in
all
the
years
hadn
t
this
game
been
tried
everyone
up
everyone
out
he
couldn
t
be
missed
the
only
man
running
alone
in
the
night
city
the
only
man
proving
his
legs
at
the
count
of
ten
now
one
two
he
felt
the
city
rise
three
he
felt
the
city
turn
to
its
thousands
of
doors
four
the
people
sleepwalking
in
their
hallways
five
he
felt
their
hands
on
the
doorknobs
the
smell
of
the
river
was
cool
and
like
a
solid
rain
his
throat
was
burnt
rust
and
his
eyes
were
wept
dry
with
running
he
yelled
as
if
this
yell
would
jet
him
on
fling
him
the
last
hundred
yards
six
seven
eight
the
doorknobs
turned
on
five
thousand
doors
nine
he
ran
out
away
from
the
last
row
of
houses
on
a
slope
leading
down
to
a
solid
moving
blackness
ten
&nbs
"p;"
the
doors
opened
he
imagined
thousands
on
thousands
of
faces
peering
into
yards
into
alleys
and
into
the
sky
faces
hid
by
curtains
pale
night
frightened
faces
like
gray
animals
peering
from
electric
caves
faces
with
gray
colorless
eyes
gray
tongues
and
gray
thoughts
looking
out
through
the
numb
flesh
of
the
face
but
he
was
at
the
river
he
touched
it
just
to
be
sure
it
was
real
he
waded
in
and
stripped
in
darkness
to
the
skin
splashed
his
body
arms
legs
and
head
with
raw
"liquor;"
drank
it
and
snuffed
some
up
his
nose
then
he
dressed
in
faber
s
old
clothes
and
shoes
he
tossed
his
own
clothing
into
the
river
and
watched
it
swept
away
then
holding
the
suitcase
he
walked
out
in
the
river
until
there
was
no
bottom
and
he
was
swept
away
in
the
dark
he
was
three
hundred
yards
downstream
when
the
hound
reached
the
river
overhead
the
great
racketing
fans
of
the
helicopters
hovered
a
storm
of
light
fell
upon
the
river
and
montag
dived
under
the
great
illumination
as
if
the
sun
had
broken
the
clouds
he
felt
the
river
pull
him
further
on
its
way
into
darkness
then
the
lights
switched
back
to
the
land
the
helicopters
swerved
over
the
city
again
as
if
they
had
picked
up
another
trail
they
were
gone
the
hound
was
gone
now
there
was
only
the
cold
river
and
montag
floating
in
a
sudden
peacefulness
away
from
the
city
and
the
lights
and
the
chase
away
from
everything
he
felt
as
if
he
had
left
a
stage
behind
and
many
actors
he
felt
as
if
he
had
left
the
great
seance
and
all
the
murmuring
ghosts
he
was
moving
from
an
unreality
that
was
frightening
into
a
reality
that
was
unreal
because
it
was
new
the
black
land
slid
by
and
he
was
going
into
the
country
among
the
hills
for
the
first
time
in
a
dozen
years
the
stars
were
coming
out
above
him
in
great
processions
of
wheeling
fire
he
saw
a
great
juggernaut
of
stars
form
in
the
sky
and
threaten
to
roll
over
and
crush
him
he
floated
on
his
back
when
the
valise
filled
and
"sank;"
the
river
was
mild
and
leisurely
going
away
from
the
people
who
ate
shadows
for
breakfast
and
steam
for
lunch
and
vapors
for
supper
the
river
was
very
"real;"
it
held
him
comfortably
and
gave
him
the
time
at
last
the
leisure
to
consider
this
month
this
year
and
a
lifetime
of
years
he
listened
to
his
heart
slow
his
thoughts
stopped
rushing
with
his
blood
he
saw
the
moon
low
in
the
sky
now
the
moon
there
and
the
light
of
the
moon
caused
by
what
by
the
sun
of
course
and
what
lights
the
sun
its
own
fire
and
the
sun
goes
on
day
after
day
burning
and
burning
the
sun
and
time
the
sun
and
time
and
burning
burning
the
river
bobbled
him
along
gently
burning
the
sun
and
every
clock
on
the
earth
it
all
came
together
and
became
a
single
thing
in
his
mind
after
a
long
time
of
floating
on
the
land
and
a
short
time
of
floating
in
the
river
he
knew
why
he
must
never
burn
again
in
his
life
the
sun
burned
every
day
it
burned
time
the
world
rushed
in
a
circle
and
turned
on
its
axis
and
time
was
busy
burning
the
years
and
the
people
anyway
without
any
help
from
him
so
if
he
burned
things
with
the
firemen
and
the
sun
burned
time
that
meant
that
everything
burned
one
of
them
had
to
stop
burning
the
sun
wouldn
t
certainly
so
it
looked
as
if
it
had
to
be
montag
and
the
people
he
had
worked
with
until
a
few
short
hours
ago
somewhere
the
saving
and
putting
away
had
to
begin
again
and
someone
had
to
do
the
saving
and
keeping
one
way
or
another
in
books
in
records
in
people
s
heads
any
way
at
all
so
long
as
it
was
safe
free
from
moths
silverfish
rust
and
dry
rot
and
men
with
matches
the
world
was
full
of
burning
of
all
types
and
sizes
now
the
guild
of
the
asbestos
weaver
must
open
shop
very
soon
he
felt
his
heel
bump
land
touch
pebbles
and
rocks
scrape
sand
the
river
had
moved
him
toward
shore
he
looked
in
at
the
great
black
creature
without
eyes
or
light
without
shape
with
only
a
size
that
went
a
thousand
miles
without
wanting
to
stop
with
its
grass
hills
and
forests
that
were
waiting
for
him
he
hesitated
to
leave
the
comforting
flow
of
the
water
he
expected
the
hound
there
suddenly
the
trees
might
blow
under
a
great
wind
of
helicopters
but
there
was
only
the
normal
autumn
wind
high
up
going
by
like
another
river
why
wasn
t
the
hound
running
why
had
the
search
veered
inland
montag
listened
nothing
nothing
millie
he
thought
all
this
country
here
listen
to
it
nothing
and
nothing
so
much
silence
millie
i
wonder
how
you
d
take
it
would
you
shout
shut
up
shut
up
millie
millie
and
he
was
sad
millie
was
not
here
and
the
hound
was
not
here
but
the
dry
smell
of
hay
blowing
from
some
distant
field
put
montag
on
the
land
he
remembered
a
farm
he
had
visited
when
he
was
very
young
one
of
the
rare
few
times
he
discovered
that
somewhere
behind
the
seven
veils
of
unreality
beyond
the
walls
of
parlors
and
beyond
the
tin
moat
of
the
city
cows
chewed
grass
and
pigs
sat
in
warm
ponds
at
noon
and
dogs
barked
after
white
sheep
on
a
hill
now
the
dry
smell
of
hay
the
motion
of
the
waters
made
him
think
of
sleeping
in
fresh
hay
in
a
lonely
barn
away
from
the
loud
highways
behind
a
quiet
farmhouse
and
under
an
ancient
windmill
that
whirred
like
the
sound
of
the
passing
years
overhead
he
lay
in
the
high
barn
loft
all
night
listening
to
distant
animals
and
insects
and
trees
the
little
motions
and
stirrings
during
the
night
he
thought
below
the
loft
he
would
hear
a
sound
like
feet
moving
perhaps
he
would
tense
and
sit
up
the
sound
would
move
away
he
would
lie
back
and
look
out
the
loft
window
very
late
in
the
night
and
see
the
lights
go
out
in
the
farmhouse
itself
until
a
very
young
and
beautiful
woman
would
sit
in
an
unlit
window
braiding
her
hair
it
would
be
hard
to
see
her
but
her
face
would
be
like
the
face
of
the
girl
so
long
ago
in
his
past
now
so
very
long
ago
the
girl
who
had
known
the
weather
and
never
been
burned
by
the
fireflies
the
girl
who
had
known
what
dandelions
meant
rubbed
off
on
your
chin
then
she
would
be
gone
from
the
warm
window
and
appear
again
upstairs
in
her
moon
whitened
room
and
then
to
the
sound
of
death
the
sound
of
the
jets
cutting
the
sky
in
two
black
pieces
beyond
the
horizon
he
would
lie
in
the
loft
hidden
and
safe
watching
those
strange
new
stars
over
the
rim
of
the
earth
fleeing
from
the
soft
color
of
dawn
in
the
morning
he
would
not
have
needed
sleep
for
all
the
warm
odors
and
sights
of
a
complete
country
night
would
have
rested
and
slept
him
while
his
eyes
were
wide
and
his
mouth
when
he
thought
to
test
it
was
half
a
smile
and
there
at
the
bottom
of
the
hayloft
stair
waiting
for
him
would
be
the
incredible
thing
he
would
step
carefully
down
in
the
pink
light
of
early
morning
so
fully
aware
of
the
world
that
he
would
be
afraid
and
stand
over
the
small
miracle
and
at
last
bend
to
touch
it
a
cool
glass
of
fresh
milk
and
a
few
apples
and
pears
laid
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
this
was
all
he
wanted
now
some
sign
that
the
immense
world
would
accept
him
and
give
him
the
long
time
he
needed
to
think
all
the
things
that
must
be
thought
a
glass
of
milk
an
apple
a
pear
he
stepped
from
the
river
the
land
rushed
at
him
a
tidal
wave
he
was
crushed
by
darkness
and
the
look
of
the
country
and
the
million
odors
on
a
wind
that
iced
his
body
he
fell
back
under
the
breaking
curve
of
darkness
and
sound
and
smell
his
ears
roaring
he
whirled
the
stars
poured
over
his
sight
like
flaming
meteors
he
wanted
to
plunge
in
the
river
again
and
let
it
idle
him
safely
on
down
somewhere
this
dark
land
rising
was
like
that
day
in
his
childhood
swimming
when
from
nowhere
the
largest
wave
in
the
history
of
remembering
slammed
him
down
in
salt
mud
and
green
darkness
water
burning
mouth
and
nose
retching
his
stomach
screaming
too
much
water
too
much
land
out
of
the
black
wall
before
him
a
whisper
a
shape
in
the
shape
two
eyes
the
night
looking
at
him
the
forest
seeing
him
the
hound
after
all
the
running
and
rushing
and
sweating
it
out
and
half
drowning
to
come
this
far
work
this
hard
and
think
yourself
safe
and
sigh
with
relief
and
come
out
on
the
land
at
last
only
to
find
the
hound
montag
gave
one
last
agonized
shout
as
if
this
were
too
much
for
any
man
the
shape
exploded
away
the
eyes
vanished
the
leaf
piles
flew
up
in
a
dry
shower
montag
was
alone
in
the
wilde
rness
a
deer
he
smelled
the
heavy
musk
like
perfume
mingled
with
blood
and
the
gummed
exhalation
of
the
animal
s
breath
all
cardamom
and
moss
and
ragweed
odor
in
this
huge
night
where
the
trees
ran
at
him
pulled
away
ran
pulled
away
to
the
pulse
of
the
heart
behind
his
eyes
there
must
have
been
a
billion
leaves
on
the
"land;"
he
waded
in
them
a
dry
river
smelling
of
hot
cloves
and
warm
dust
and
the
other
smells
there
was
a
smell
like
a
cut
potato
from
all
the
land
raw
and
cold
and
white
from
having
the
moon
on
it
most
of
the
night
there
was
a
smell
like
pickles
from
a
bottle
and
a
smell
like
parsley
on
the
table
at
home
there
was
a
faint
yellow
odor
like
mustard
from
a
jar
there
was
a
smell
like
carnations
from
the
yard
next
door
he
put
down
his
hand
and
felt
a
weed
rise
up
like
a
child
brushing
him
his
fingers
smelled
of
licorice
he
stood
breathing
and
the
more
he
breathed
the
land
in
the
more
he
was
filled
up
with
all
the
details
of
the
land
he
was
not
empty
there
was
more
than
enough
here
to
fill
him
there
would
always
be
more
than
enough
he
walked
in
the
shallow
tide
of
leaves
stumbling
and
in
the
middle
of
the
strangeness
a
familiarity
his
foot
hit
something
that
rang
dully
he
moved
his
hand
on
the
ground
a
yard
this
way
a
yard
that
the
railroad
track
the
track
that
came
out
of
the
city
and
rusted
across
the
land
through
forests
and
woods
deserted
now
by
the
river
here
was
the
path
to
wherever
he
was
going
here
was
the
single
familiar
thing
the
magic
charm
he
might
need
a
little
while
to
touch
to
feel
beneath
his
feet
as
he
moved
on
into
the
bramble
bushes
and
the
lakes
of
smelling
and
feeling
and
touching
among
the
whispers
and
the
blowing
down
of
leaves
he
walked
on
the
track
and
he
was
surprised
to
learn
how
certain
he
suddenly
was
of
a
single
fact
he
could
not
prove
once
long
ago
clarisse
had
walked
here
where
he
was
walking
now
half
an
hour
later
cold
and
moving
carefully
on
the
tracks
fully
aware
of
his
entire
body
his
face
his
mouth
his
eyes
stuffed
with
blackness
his
ears
stuffed
with
sound
his
legs
prickled
with
burrs
and
nettles
he
saw
the
fire
ahead
the
fire
was
gone
then
back
again
like
a
winking
eye
he
stopped
afraid
he
might
blow
the
fire
out
with
a
single
breath
but
the
fire
was
there
and
he
approached
warily
from
a
long
way
off
it
took
the
better
part
of
fifteen
minutes
before
he
drew
very
close
indeed
to
it
and
then
he
stood
looking
at
it
from
cover
that
small
motion
the
white
and
red
color
a
strange
fire
because
it
meant
a
different
thing
to
him
it
was
not
burning
it
was
warming
he
saw
many
hands
held
to
its
warmth
hands
without
arms
hidden
in
darkness
above
the
hands
motionless
faces
that
were
only
moved
and
tossed
and
flickered
with
firelight
he
hadn
t
known
fire
could
look
this
way
he
had
never
thought
in
his
life
that
it
could
give
as
well
as
take
even
its
smell
was
different
how
long
he
stood
he
did
not
know
but
there
was
a
foolish
and
yet
delicious
sense
of
knowing
himself
as
an
animal
come
from
the
forest
drawn
by
the
fire
he
was
a
thing
of
brush
and
liquid
eye
of
fur
and
muzzle
and
hoof
he
was
a
thing
of
horn
and
blood
that
would
smell
like
autumn
if
you
bled
it
out
on
the
ground
he
stood
a
long
long
time
listening
to
the
warm
crackle
of
the
flames
there
was
a
silence
gathered
all
about
that
fire
and
the
silence
was
in
the
men
s
faces
and
time
was
there
time
enough
to
sit
by
this
rusting
track
under
the
trees
and
look
at
the
world
and
turn
it
over
with
the
eyes
as
if
it
were
held
to
the
center
of
the
bonfire
a
piece
of
steel
these
men
were
all
shaping
it
was
not
only
the
fire
that
was
different
it
was
the
silence
montag
moved
toward
this
special
silence
that
was
concerned
with
all
of
the
world
and
then
the
voices
began
and
they
were
talking
and
he
could
hear
nothing
of
what
the
voices
said
but
the
sound
rose
and
fell
quietly
and
the
voices
were
turning
the
world
over
and
looking
at
"it;"
the
voices
knew
the
land
and
the
trees
and
the
city
which
lay
down
the
track
by
the
river
the
voices
talked
of
everything
there
was
nothing
they
could
not
talk
about
he
knew
from
the
very
cadence
and
motion
and
continual
stir
of
curiosity
and
wonder
in
them
and
then
one
of
the
men
looked
up
and
saw
him
for
the
first
or
perhaps
the
seventh
time
and
a
voice
called
to
montag:
all
right
you
can
come
out
now
montag
stepped
back
in
the
shadows
it
s
all
right
the
voice
said
you
re
welcome
here
montag
walked
slowly
toward
the
fire
and
the
five
old
men
sitting
there
dressed
in
dark
blue
denim
pants
and
jackets
and
dark
blue
shirts
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
them
sit
down
said
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
the
leader
of
the
small
group
have
some
coffee
he
watched
the
dark
steaming
mixture
pour
into
a
collapsible
tin
cup
which
was
handed
him
straight
off
he
sipped
it
gingerly
and
felt
them
looking
at
him
with
curiosity
his
lips
were
scalded
but
that
was
good
the
faces
around
him
were
bearded
but
the
beards
were
clean
neat
and
their
hands
were
clean
they
had
stood
up
as
if
to
welcome
a
guest
and
now
they
sat
down
again
montag
sipped
thanks
he
said
thanks
very
much
you
re
welcome
montag
my
name
s
granger
he
held
out
a
small
bottle
of
colorless
fluid
drink
this
too
it
ll
change
the
chemical
index
of
your
perspiration
half
an
hour
from
now
you
ll
smell
like
two
other
people
with
the
hound
after
you
the
best
thing
is
bottoms
up
montag
drank
the
bitter
fluid
you
ll
stink
like
a
bobcat
but
that
s
all
right
said
granger
you
know
my
name
said
montag
granger
nodded
to
a
portable
battery
tv
set
by
the
fire
we
ve
watched
the
chase
figured
you
d
wind
up
south
along
the
river
when
we
heard
you
plunging
around
out
in
the
forest
like
a
drunken
elk
we
didn
t
hide
as
we
usually
do
we
figured
you
were
in
the
river
when
the
helicopter
cameras
swung
back
in
over
the
city
something
funny
there
the
chase
is
still
running
the
other
way
though
the
other
way
let
s
have
a
look
granger
snapped
the
portable
viewer
on
the
picture
was
a
nightmare
condensed
easily
passed
from
hand
to
hand
in
the
forest
all
whirring
color
and
flight
a
voice
cried:
the
chase
continues
north
in
the
city
police
helicopters
are
converging
on
avenue
87
and
elm
grove
park
granger
nodded
they
re
faking
you
threw
them
off
at
the
river
they
can
t
admit
it
they
know
they
can
hold
their
audience
only
so
long
the
show
s
got
to
have
a
snap
ending
quick
if
they
started
searching
the
whole
damn
river
it
might
take
all
night
so
they
re
sniffing
for
a
scapegoat
to
end
things
with
a
bang
watch
they
ll
catch
montag
in
the
next
five
minutes
but
how
watch
the
camera
hovering
in
the
belly
of
a
helicopter
now
swung
down
at
an
empty
street:
see
that
whispered
granger
it
ll
be
"you;"
right
up
at
the
end
of
that
street
is
our
victim
see
how
our
camera
in
coming
in
building
the
scene
suspense
long
shot
right
now
some
poor
fellow
is
out
for
a
walk
a
rarity
an
odd
one
don
t
think
the
police
don
t
know
the
habits
of
queer
ducks
like
that
men
who
walk
mornings
for
the
hell
of
it
or
for
reasons
of
insomnia
anyway
the
police
have
had
him
charted
for
months
years
never
know
when
that
sort
of
information
might
be
handy
and
today
it
turns
out
it
s
very
usable
indeed
it
saves
face
oh
god
look
there
the
men
at
the
fire
bent
forward
on
the
screen
a
man
turned
a
corner
the
mechanical
hound
rushed
forward
into
the
viewer
suddenly
the
helicopter
lights
shot
down
a
dozen
brilliant
pillars
that
built
a
cage
all
about
the
man
a
voice
cried
there
s
montag
the
search
is
done
the
innocent
man
stood
bewildered
a
cigarette
burning
in
his
hand
he
stared
at
the
hound
not
knowing
what
it
was
he
probably
never
knew
he
glanced
up
at
the
sky
and
the
wailing
sirens
the
camera
rushed
down
the
hound
leapt
up
into
the
air
with
a
rhythm
and
a
sense
of
timing
that
was
incredibly
beautiful
its
needle
shot
out
it
was
suspended
for
a
moment
in
their
gaze
as
if
to
give
the
vast
audience
time
to
appreciate
everything
the
raw
look
of
the
victim
s
face
the
empty
street
the
steel
animal
a
bullet
nosing
the
target
montag
don
t
move
said
a
voice
from
the
sky
the
camera
fell
upon
the
victim
even
as
did
the
hound
both
reached
him
simultaneously
the
victim
was
seized
by
hound
and
camera
in
a
great
spidering
clenching
grip
he
screamed
he
screamed
he
screamed
blackout
silence
darkness
montag
cried
out
in
the
silence
and
turned
away
silence
and
then
after
a
time
of
the
men
sitting
around
the
fire
their
faces
expressionless
an
announcer
on
the
dark
screen
said
the
search
is
over
montag
is
"dead;"
a
crime
against
society
has
been
avenged
darkness
we
now
take
you
to
the
sky
room
of
the
hotel
lux
for
a
half
hour
of
just
before
dawn
a
program
of
granger
turned
it
off
they
didn
t
show
the
man
s
face
in
focus
did
you
notice
even
your
best
friends
couldn
t
tell
if
it
was
you
they
scrambled
it
just
enough
to
let
the
imagination
take
over
hell
he
whispered
hell
montag
said
nothing
but
now
looking
back
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
to
the
black
screen
trembling
granger
touched
montag
s
arm
welcome
back
from
the
dead
montag
nodded
granger
went
on

time

of
mistakes

s
here
and
the
hour
s
late
and
the
war
s
begun
and
we
are
out
here
and
the
city
is
there
all
wrapped
up
in
its
own
coat
of
a
thousand
colors
what
do
you
think
montag
i
think
i
was
blind
trying
to
go
at
things
my
way
planting
books
in
firemen
s
houses
and
sending
in
alarms
you
did
what
you
had
to
do
carried
out
on
a
national
scale
it
might
have
worked
beautifully
but
our
way
is
simpler
and
we
think
better
all
we
want
to
do
is
keep
the
knowledge
we
think
we
will
need
intact
and
safe
we
re
not
out
to
incite
or
anger
anyone
yet
for
if
we
are
destroyed
the
knowledge
is
dead
perhaps
for
good
we
are
model
citizens
in
our
own
special
"way;"
we
walk
the
old
tracks
we
lie
in
the
hills
at
night
and
the
city
people
let
us
be
we
re
stopped
and
searched
occasionally
but
there
s
nothing
on
our
persons
to
incriminate
us
the
organization
is
flexible
very
loose
and
fragmentary
some
of
us
have
had
plastic
surgery
on
our
faces
and
fingerprints
right
now
we
have
a
horrible
"job;"
we
re
waiting
for
the
war
to
begin
and
as
quickly
end
it
s
not
pleasant
but
then
we
re
not
in
control
we
re
the
odd
minority
crying
in
the
wilderness
when
the
war
s
over
perhaps
we
can
be
of
some
use
in
the
world
do
you
really
think
they
ll
listen
then
if
not
we
ll
just
have
to
wait
we
ll
pass
the
books
on
to
our
children
by
word
of
mouth
and
let
our
children
wait
in
turn
on
the
other
people
a
lot
will
be
lost
that
way
of
course
but
you
can
t
make
people
listen
they
have
to
come
round
in
their
own
time
wondering
what
happened
and
why
the
world
blew
up
under
them
it
can
t
last
how
many
of
you
are
there
thousands
on
the
roads
the
abandoned
railtracks
tonight
bums
on
the
outside
libraries
inside
it
wasn
t
planned
at
first
each
man
had
a
book
he
wanted
to
remember
and
did
then
over
a
period
of
twenty
years
or
so
we
met
each
other
traveling
and
got
the
loose
network
together
and
set
out
a
plan
the
most
important
single
thing
we
had
to
pound
into
ourselves
is
that
we
were
not
important
we
mustn
t
be
"pedants;"
we
were
not
to
feel
superior
to
anyone
else
in
the
world
we
re
nothing
more
than
dust
jackets
for
books
of
no
significance
otherwise
some
of
us
live
in
small
towns
chapter
one
of
thoreau
s
walden
in
green
river
chapter
two
in
willow
farm
maine
why
there
s
one
town
in
maryland
only
twenty
seven
people
no
bomb
ll
ever
touch
that
town
is
the
compete
essays
of
a
man
named
bertrand
russell
pick
up
that
town
almost
and
flip
the
pages
so
many
pages
to
a
person
and
when
the
war
s
over
some
day
some
year
the
books
can
be
written
again
the
people
will
be
called
in
one
by
one
to
recite
what
they
know
and
we
ll
set
it
up
in
type
until
another
dark
age
when
we
might
have
to
do
the
whole
damn
thing
over
again
but
that
s
the
wonderful
thing
about
"man;"
he
never
gets
so
discouraged
or
disgusted
that
he
gives
up
doing
it
all
over
again
because
he
knows
very
well
it
is
important
and
worth
the
doing
what
do
we
do
tonight
asked
montag
wait
said
granger
and
move
downstream
a
little
ways
just
in
case
he
began
throwing
dust
and
dirt
in
the
fire
the
other
men
helped
and
montag
helped
and
there
in
the
wilderness
the
men
all
moved
their
hands
putting
out
the
fire
together
they
stood
by
the
river
in
the
starlight
montag
saw
the
luminous
dial
of
his
waterproof
five
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
another
year
ticked
by
in
a
single
hour
and
dawn
waiting
beyond
the
far
bank
of
the
river
why
do
you
trust
me
said
montag
a
man
moved
in
the
darkness
the
look
of
you
s
enough
you
haven
t
seen
yourself
in
a
mirror
lately
beyond
that
the
city
has
never
cared
so
much
about
us
to
bother
with
an
elaborate
chase
like
this
to
find
us
a
few
crackpots
with
verses
in
their
heads
can
t
touch
them
and
they
know
it
and
we
know
"it;"
everyone
knows
it
so
long
as
the
vast
population
doesn
t
wander
about
quoting
the
magna
carta
and
the
constitution
it
s
all
right
the
firemen
were
enough
to
check
that
now
and
then
no
the
cities
don
t
bother
us
and
you
look
like
hell
they
moved
along
the
bank
of
the
river
going
south
montag
tried
to
see
the
men
s
faces
the
old
faces
he
remembered
from
the
firelight
lined
and
tired
he
was
looking
for
a
brightness
a
resolve
a
triumph
over
tomorrow
that
hardly
seemed
to
be
there
perhaps
he
had
expected
their
faces
to
burn
and
glitter
with
the
knowledge
they
carried
to
glow
as
lanterns
glow
with
the
light
in
them
but
all
the
light
had
come
from
the
campfire
and
these
men
had
seemed
no
different
than
any
others
who
had
run
a
long
race
searched
a
long
search
seen
good
things
destroyed
and
now
very
late
were
gathered
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
party
and
the
blowing
out
of
the
lamps
they
weren
t
at
all
certain
that
the
things
they
carried
in
their
heads
might
make
every
future
dawn
glow
with
a
purer
light
they
were
sure
of
nothing
save
that
the
books
were
on
file
behind
their
quiet
eyes
the
books
were
waiting
with
their
pages
uncut
for
the
customers
who
might
come
by
in
later
years
some
with
clean
and
some
with
dirty
fingers
montag
squinted
from
one
face
to
another
as
they
walked
don
t
judge
a
book
by
its
cover
someone
said
and
they
all
laughed
quietly
moving
downstream
there
was
a
shriek
and
the
jets
from
the
city
were
gone
overhead
long
before
the
men
looked
up
montag
stared
back
at
the
city
far
down
the
river
only
a
faint
glow
now
my
wife
s
back
there
i
m
sorry
to
hear
that
the
cities
won
t
do
well
in
the
next
few
days
said
granger
it
s
strange
i
don
t
miss
her
it
s
strange
i
don
t
feel
much
of
anything
said
montag
even
if
she
dies
i
realized
a
moment
ago
i
don
t
think
i
ll
feel
sad
it
isn
t
right
something
must
be
wrong
with
me
listen
said
granger
taking
his
arm
and
walking
with
him
holding
aside
the
bushes
to
let
him
pass
when
i
was
a
boy
my
grandfather
died
and
he
was
a
sculptor
he
was
also
a
very
kind
man
who
had
a
lot
of
love
to
give
the
world
and
he
helped
clean
up
the
slum
in
our
"town;"
and
he
made
toys
for
us
and
he
did
a
million
things
in
his
"lifetime;"
he
was
always
busy
with
his
hands
and
when
he
died
i
suddenly
realized
i
wasn
t
crying
for
him
at
all
but
for
all
the
things
he
did
i
cried
because
he
would
never
do
them
again
he
would
never
carve
another
piece
of
wood
or
help
us
raise
doves
and
pigeons
in
the
back
yard
or
play
the
violin
the
way
he
did
or
tell
us
jokes
the
way
he
did
he
was
part
of
us
and
when
he
died
all
the
actions
stopped
dead
and
there
was
no
one
to
do
them
just
the
way
he
did
he
was
individual
he
was
an
important
man
i
ve
never
gotten
over
his
death
often
i
think
what
wonderful
carvings
never
came
to
birth
because
he
died
how
many
jokes
are
missing
from
the
world
and
how
many
homing
pigeons
untouched
by
his
hands
he
shaped
the
world
he
did
things
to
the
world
the
world
was
bankrupted
of
ten
million
fine
actions
the
night
he
passed
on
montag
walked
in
silence
millie
millie
he
whispered
millie
what
my
wife
my
wife
poor
millie
poor
poor
millie
i
can
t
remember
anything
i
think
of
her
hands
but
i
don
t
see
them
doing
anything
at
all
they
just
hang
there
at
her
sides
or
they
lie
there
on
her
lap
or
there
s
a
cigarette
in
them
but
that
s
all
montag
turned
and
glanced
back
what
did
you
give
to
the
city
montag
ashes
what
did
the
others
give
to
each
other
